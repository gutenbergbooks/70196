<p>The Evil Eye is a superstition arising not from local
circumstances, or peculiarity of a great or small division
of the human family, but is a result of an original
tendency of the human mind. The natural irritation
felt at the hostile look of a neighbour, still more of
an enemy, is implanted in the breast of all, however
much they may be influenced by moral teaching.
When we add to this the feeling that some valued
possession has attracted the coveteous desire of
another, the fear of loss is added to the irritation
of mere anger. To some such natural feeling we
must ascribe the belief in an Evil Eye.</p>

<p>Theories of an origin more restricted, founded on
the fear of loss or damage to particular possessions
of individuals guaranteed them by the custom of law,
developed in the community of which they form
part, scarcely satisfy after inquiry. Where a subsistence
can be easily procured the Evil Eye would
be little regarded in connection with food, but might
naturally develop itself in connection with the relations
of the sexes. No doubt the latter, the most interesting
to individuals of all passions, causes feelings
of hostility between rivals universally, but where the
food supply is difficult to procure one would naturally<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</span>
expect that damage from the covetous desires of
others, where they seemed to affect the life-preserving
store, would become equally important.</p>

<p>In the following study of the belief of an Evil Eye
among the Gaelic-speaking peoples of Scotland at the
present day, an attempt is made neither to disguise
nor to improve upon what those in contact with
believers have learned from their mouths. The writer
is a believer in the Evil Eye only in so far as it may
be a term for the natural selfishness of the human
being, as a “tender heart” is a recognised way of
speaking of a nature apt to sympathy. Selfishness,
natural to all of us, is apt to find expression in our
habits, however much we may disguise it by religious
or charitable profession. Were it a part of our nature
to have for our neighbour the same affection that we
have for ourselves, no such superstition as that of
the Evil Eye could have arisen. But we are not
made that way, and so reformers, in endeavouring
to cure this sin, as they consider it, have preached
and tried to practise such ordinances as “Thou shalt
not covet,” and “Thou shalt love thy neighbour as
thyself.” Truly hard sayings, and in nine hundred
and ninety-nine cases out of a thousand with difficulty
getting beyond the status of a pious opinion.</p>

<p>Not that that teaching has been without effect; and
we may hope that with the extension of communications
and the progress gradually being made to that
condition of things where</p>

<p>the <i>bad e’e</i> may some day in these isles be merely a
study for folklorists as Totemism is, and as difficult
to find as an auk’s egg.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</span></p>

<p>Right or wrong, the theory here advanced accounts,
satisfactorily, as far as the writer can judge,
for the present-day widespread belief in Scotland
of the power for evil of the glance of the human
eye.</p>

<p>As will be seen afterwards, there are those who
theorise on the bad heart influencing the eye, the ill
effect of the Evil Eye only arising from the glance
of the covetous; but this is probably the result of
preconceived religious ideas, and of the moral teaching
to which its believers have been accustomed. It
is not to be wondered at; it would be impossible
indeed, but that the teaching of Christianity should
have affected and given a direction to this ancient
superstition. Thus we find it Christianised to a
marked degree, its origin is conceived of as a breaking
of the commandment “Thou shalt not covet,” and
its cures are mostly connected with a reference to
the Deity, and to the Trinity of the Christian. The
magic thread with the three knots on it, though
heathen in its origin, has surely some connection with
the rosary, the aspersion with water, with baptism,
and the holy water of the Roman Church. But it
is not a superstition introduced with Christianity, it
is as native as the heather of our hills, or the sandstone
rock of the Coronation Stone.</p>

<p>This statement might be safely enough advanced
upon general principles, but we are not without satisfactory
literary evidence of what we advance. In the
Ossianic “<i>Acallam na Senorach</i>” (The Colloquy with
the Ancient Men), the second longest prose composition
of the mediæval Irish, a collection (probably
made in the late twelfth or thirteenth century) of
separate stories united together in one framework, we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span>
find the following as related in MSS. of the fifteenth
century and later.</p>

<p>The Fiann are on a visit to the King of Munster.
The son of the King of Ulster marries the daughter
of the King of Munster.</p>

<p>“The damsel bore him a famous and beautiful son
named Fer Oc (‘young man’), and in all Ireland there
were scarcely one whose shape and vigour and spear-casting
were as good as his.”</p>

<p>On a subsequent visit, the three battalions of the
Fiann are lost in admiration of the activity and skill
of a young man who turns out to be this Fer Oc.
“Then was a hunt and a battue held by the three
battalions of the Fiann. Howbeit, on that day, owing
to Fer Oc (and his superior skill) to none of the
Fiann it fell to get first blood of pig or deer. Now
when they came home, after finishing the hunt, a
sore lung-disease attacked Fer Oc, through the (evil)
eyes of the multitude and the envy of the great host,
and it killed him, soulless, at the end of nine days.”
“He was buried on yonder green-grassed hill,” says
Cailte, “and the shining stone that he held when he
was at games and diversion is that yonder rising out
of his head.”<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> The Gaelic here simply says “<i lang="gd">tre
tsuilib na sochaide</i>” (through the eyes of the multitude),
and it will be seen that modern reciters sometimes
speak in exactly the same way of the “eye”
unqualified, but meaning the Evil Eye. But there is
more than this in the story; it is a young man who
suffers, and the young are most easily affected. It
is a remarkable and handsome youth that suffers, and
what attracts the eye, especially beauty, is peculiarly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span>
liable to injury, and the statement is made that it
was the envious glance which affected the victim.
<i>Cormac’s Glossary</i> (an Irish compilation begun in the
tenth century, and added to throughout the Middle
Ages), preserved in MSS. of the commencement of the
fifteenth century, mentions the Evil Eye:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i lang="gd">Milled</i> (spoiling, hurting, (<i>b</i>) <i>i.e.</i> <i lang="gd">mi shilledh</i>, a mislook,
<i>i.e.</i> an evil eye).</p>

<p><i lang="gd">Millead i mi shillead i silled olc.</i> [Or as in
another MS.]</p>

<p><i lang="gd">Milliud quasi mishilliud i drochshilliud.</i></p>
</div>

<p>To this O’Clery adds “<i lang="gd">no droch amharc</i>,” while
O’Donovan’s note at (<i>b</i>) is “the evil eye,” “the injury
done by the evil eye.”<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Our business is with the so-called facts of the Evil
Eye, and whether or not in this case the philology
of the compiler of the <i>Glossary</i> is right, there can be
no sort of doubt of the allusion being to the present
living belief in the Evil Eye.</p>

<p>Apart from the doing of evil, and causing sickness
and death without immediate increase to the possessions
of the witch, the effect of the Evil Eye centres
round the natural covetousness of the greedy person.
Where the owner of an evil eye gets no benefit himself,
the effect ascribed is always to diminish what he
might envy in the possession of another. It is always
the young and <i lang="gd">toradh</i> of cattle (milk and butter), or
the fruits of the labour of the owner that is lessened
or destroyed. Whatever the philological root of this
word <i lang="gd">toradh</i>, it must surely be allied with the irregular
verb <i lang="gd">thoir</i> (give); and though there seems at first sight
no close relationship between personal beauty and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
a good churning, yet both of them are highly prized
gifts. <i lang="gd">Toradh</i> means fruit produce; thus Cain’s offering
was the <i lang="gd">toradh</i> of the earth.</p>

<p>The expression used in Kintyre for the power of
taking away produce is <i lang="gd">pisreag</i>. In Arran the word
applied to the curative measures is <i lang="gd">pisearachd</i>. <i lang="gd">Piseach</i>
means increase; thus in Proverbs xviii. 20, where it is
said that a man shall be filled with the “increase of
his lips,” the Gaelic word used is <i lang="gd">piseach</i>, and so it
comes to mean progeny and good fortune. <i lang="gd">Piseach
ort</i> (Good fortune be yours). Irish Gaelic gives <i lang="gd">piseog</i>
(witchcraft). Surely this is a secondary meaning from
the idea of increase and good fortune being in certain
cases brought about by charms and witchery. And
thus we have found <i lang="gd">pisearachd</i> explained as the Arran
and Kintyre equivalent for <i lang="gd">geasarachd</i>, of which all
the evidence seems to favour its primary signification
being connected with spells and charms.</p>

<p>Another word which has been used to collectors
for <i lang="gd">eolas</i> (science of its own magical sort) is <i lang="gd">fiosachd</i>,
which the dictionaries give as meaning “foretelling,”
“augury.” This seems to be a secondary and limited
application of a term meaning possession of <i lang="gd">fios</i>
(knowledge, information).</p>

<p>The popular mixing up of legitimate curative
measures, such as come from the administration of
drugs, with what undoubtedly is considered illegitimate,
namely, the use of charms and sorcery in
general, is of course as common as can be in the
experience of those in contact with genuine savagery,
but it occurs also nearer home. A native of Arran
tells how she remembers an old woman, of whom the
people were afraid because she was supposed to be a
witch. The groundwork of this accusation was that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>
she was to be often seen gathering herbs, and the
reciter remembers when she herself was a girl, that,
to use her own words, it was “the fright of her life”
to meet her in a lonely place, or in the dark.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>An inquiry such as this has to be conducted with
care. The believer is sensitive to ridicule, and would
take as a mortal offence being publicly gibbeted, so
as to cause animadversion from others, even when he
himself is convinced of the truth of his beliefs and
sayings. For this reason we must be excused giving
the name and residence of the various reciters. The
information has to be drawn in general conversation
and incidentally, but every care has been taken to
avoid recounting anything in which <i lang="la">mala fides</i> is
suspected. We consider in many cases things told
by a daughter of her mother, or a son of his father,
as equally reliable as if detailed by himself when we
know they have been recited originally for information
of the juniors. Undoubtedly the younger generation
are in many cases more critical than their forefathers;
but we have no hesitation in maintaining that what
will hereafter be set down allows of a fairly perfect
appreciation of the belief of the great majority of the
less educated class, and of many much above that in
the West Highlands, up to the introduction of the
School Board as a universal institution. Of course
there always were doubters, and the tricks played to
take a rise out of a believer by an unbeliever may
sometimes figure as accepted evidence of the bad
effects of the Evil Eye, when it was a trick played
off merely for fun, though in other cases deliberately
intended to mislead. Tricks, however, will not carry
us back to an original cause, however much they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
may have helped the maintenance of the belief in
superstitious minds. These fail entirely in power of
appreciation of the jocular, when what is done is
dangerous according to their ideas. A strong believer
in the Evil Eye, and of course much afraid of it, in
the island of Skye, was one day out among the cows.
Two of his neighbours passing, one of them, a bit of
a wag, said to his companion: “<i lang="gd">Bheir mi da sgillinn
duit ma theid thu agus do cheann a chuir fodh’n mhart
sin agus glaodh ’nach mor an t-uth tha aig a bho</i>” (“I
will give you twopence if you will go and put your
head under that cow and cry, Hasn’t the cow the big
udder?”)</p>

<p>The fellow agreed, and went and bent his head
under the cow and shouted out at the top of his
voice, calling Rory’s attention to his supposititious
admiration of the remarkable development of the cow
in question. The man tempted to make the remark
was “a little soft.” Rory at once thinking of the
Evil Eye, seized his stick and rushed at him, threatening
to break his head if he would not at once bless
the cow. The suborned perpetrator of the joke, it
need scarcely be said, at once took the method demanded
to counteract his injudicious praise. How
many of us are, not in the belief of the Evil Eye, but
in other beliefs, just as touchy as our friend Rory.</p>

<p>The stick may be good enough for a defence of
superstition, but ridicule is the proper method of
attack.</p>

<p>A young intelligent lady was lately in a house in the
village of Golspie, the occupant of which, mourning
over the dying of her fowls, said she suspected it was
the result of the Evil Eye of Mrs. X., a neighbour.
The next day, being in the same house, another<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>
neighbour came in carrying a growing plant, which
she presented to the complainer, saying: “Mrs. X.
told me that you had your eye on this, and ever
since it has done no good; the leaves have been
withering and falling off. Now!—there it is to you!
keep it.”</p>

<p>The person superstitious enough to believe in the
force of the Evil Eye may well be expected to have
his superstitious faculty developed in other directions.
A child took ill, and its parents believed it was the
Evil Eye of a certain woman which had done the
harm. With the view of bringing her to confess her
doings, or in any case to punish her, they procured a
square of turf, and having stuck a lot of pins in it,
they placed it on the fire. This action, one of the
forms of the so-called <i lang="gd">corp creadha</i>, was intended to
do personal injury to the suspected party. There
was no evidence of it having had any effect
whatever.</p>

<p>After the long existence in this country of Christianity,
while we talk composedly of the superstitions
of the heathen and of other Christian nations, we are
apt to forget our own, or if we speak of them, we look
on them pityingly as peculiar to some individuals of
whose opinion we reckon little. In towns, and among
those who read many books, the constant friction of
man against man hinders the survival of a belief in
such a thing as the Evil Eye, now that a certain
quantity of education is common property. Where
the incidents of life are less crowded, and individual
experiences are rarer and at longer intervals, that is, in
country districts and especially in the more mountainous
and less closely populated, the Evil Eye has yet
in Scotland many believers, and consequently considerable
influence. Such a remark as the following,
made to a minister, is not so rare as one might
suppose: “Nae doot whatever Mac had the Evil
Eye, that’s certain. I have known many cases when
a calf, or even a cow, died the day after he looked
at her.” Another said of the same: “I was once in the
dairy when he came in. ‘You should not have let that
bad man in,’ said Nancy MacIntyre to me. ‘Why?’
said I. ‘Because he has an Evil Eye,’ said she.
Now, I will not say that this was true, but this I know,
that on that very day one of the cows bursted, and
died from eating clover. What do ye say to that?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span></p>

<p>Another sample is the following: A farmer’s son,
whose father had lost a horse, was thus addressed by
a neighbour, “You had a horse that was ill, is it
better?” “Oh no, it is dead.” “You are unfortunate
this year. Isn’t that four that have died on
you?” “Yes, but we know now what was wrong with
them.” “Weel, that’s well; ye’ll know what to do
should any more take ill. What was wrong with
them?” “They were <i lang="gd">air-an-cronachadh</i>” (harmed).
“Such nonsense! there is nothing of that now.”
The lad did not agree with this, said they knew who
did it, and the lad’s interrogator’s mother-in-law joined
in the conversation, agreeing as to the correctness
of the diagnosis; and the doubter rejoined, “Well,
if you are all against me, I may stop.”</p>

<p>An Argyllshire islander says:—</p>

<p>“<i lang="gd">Tha buideachas uile air falbh anis agus is math
gu bheil, oir be ni olc a bha ann. Ach, ma dh’fhalbh
sin, tha rud eile nach d’fhalbh fathast, agus ‘se sin
cronachadh. Chunnaic m’i ann mo thigh fein mucuircean,
agus thainig ban-choimhearsnach a steach latha,
agus thubhairt i gum bu mhuc ciatach a bha’n sin.
‘Tha i gle mhath,’ fhreagair mi fhein. Well, chaidh
am boireannach a mach, agus cha robh i tiota air
falbh, nur a thug a mhuc an aon sgreach aisde agus air
dol mun cuairt dith, thuit i air an urlar. Le so, thainig
D. ‘ac A. a stigh, agus fheoraich e ‘Co an t-aon mu
dheireadh a chunnaic a mhuc?’ Dh’ innis mi fhein dha,
gum be a leithid so ‘a bhean. ‘Mata’ ars esan, ‘s ise
rinn an t-olc. Ach ma tha uillidh sam bi lar ruit, cha
chreid mi gum bi mise fada ga cuir ceirt. Fhuair mi
dha uillidh nam piocach, agus ghabh e a mhuc eadar a dha
chois, agus thaom e lan copa dheth na beul. Thug a
mhuc reibhig, agus shaoil mi fhein gu robh i air chuthach<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
ach ann a’ mionaid a dh’uine, bha i ceirt gu leoir; Nis,
nach be sud an droch bhean?</i>”</p>

<p>(“Witchcraft is all gone now, and it is well it is, for it
was a bad thing. But if that is gone, there is another
thing that has not gone yet, and that is <i lang="gd">Cronachadh</i>.
I saw a breeding sow in my own house, and one day
a neighbour came in, and she said that that was a
splendid sow. I answered that she was very good.
Well, the woman went out, and she was no time away
when the sow gave such a scream, and going round
about she fell on the floor. With this D. Mac A.
came in, and he asked who was the last person that
had seen the sow. I told him it was such and such
a woman. ‘Well,’ said he, ‘it was she that did the
harm, but if you have any oil beside you, I believe I
shall not be long putting her right.’ I got saithe oil
for him, and he took the sow between his two legs,
and poured a cupful into her mouth. She screamed,
and I thought she was mad, but in a minute’s time
she was all right. Now, wasn’t that the bad woman?”)</p>

<p>A young fellow who had received a liberal education,
in fact, a probationer of the Church, the son
of a self-made man, fairly well-to-do, avowed his own
belief in the Evil Eye. He said in effect: “As sure
as you and I are sitting here there is an Evil Eye in
it. I know that when I was in Harris, and our M.
an infant, there was a certain woman who used to
come in pretty often, the sister-in-law of H., you
know, and my wife, who you know is not one to
tell a lie or speak about these things, told me that
every time that woman came in she would be praising
the child, and the child was always unwell after it.”</p>

<p>We thus see, though we know that ministers of the
Church are by their profession kept in the dark on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
matters of which they would express unbelief, yet
that where a superstition is ingrained in a parishioner
it is not concealed from the minister. Ministers may
be misled by putting their own interpretation on the
form in which the information comes to them. A
clergyman in one of the Western Islands said: “I
have observed that there is still a strong belief in
blighting from the Evil Eye among the people in the
parish of K. A respectable and intelligent man
whom I visited often during a season of sickness,
once and again, when talking about his illness, made
the remark ‘<i lang="gd">fhuair mi cronachadh</i>.’ I always misunderstood
what the man meant by <i lang="gd">cronachadh</i>, taking
it in the sense of reproof, and therefore thinking
that what was meant was that the sufferer was placed
under chastisement by a dispensation of Providence.
At last, however, I learned from a third person that
the sick man was strongly impressed with the belief
that his illness was caused by some evil-intentioned
person who had wished him ill.” This suggests witchcraft
as much as or even more than the Evil Eye;
but the two things run into each other more or less.
We have already seen one Gaelic reciter maintaining
that witchcraft, <i lang="gd">buidseachas</i>, did not now exist, but the
Evil Eye did. Compare that with this from a native
of Uist:—</p>

<p>“<i lang="gd">Ma ta bha buidseashas ann. Chaidh mi fhein
aon latha gu tigh coimhearsnaich airson coileach oig,
agus bha laogh aca ceangailte aig cul an doruis. Cha
robh mi fada san tigh gus an d’thainig nighean a
steach. ’Nuair a fhuair mise an t-eun, dh’fhalbh mi,
agus cha robh mi ach beagan uine air falbh ’nuair a
dh’fhas an laogh tinn. Chuir muinntir an tighe fios
thun boireannach a bha ’n sin, aig an robh sgil mu<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
bhuidseachas, mar bhiodh daoine ’g radh, ga h-iarruidh
a thighinn a dh’-amhairc an laogh. Thainig am boireannach,
ach ma thainig, bha an laogh marbh mus
d’thainig i. Co luath ’s a dh’amhairc i air thubhairt i
riutha air an spot gum b’e ’n “suill” a dh’aobhraich am
bas. Agus air bharrachd air sin, dh’innis i dhoibh co
rinn an gonadh. So mar thubhairt i. “Nach robh
dithist bhoireannaich agaibh an so am eigin an diugh?”
Agus ’nuair a fhreagair iad gun robh, thubhairt ise.
“Bha h-aon diubh soilleir, agus an te eile dorcha. Bha
shawl glas air an te shoilleir, agus b’bise a dh’oibrich am
buidseachas.</i>”</p>

<p>“<i lang="gd">Nis bha sin gle fhior, oir bha an nighean a thainig
a steach nur bha mise san tigh soilleir, agus bha shawl
glas oirre cuideachd.</i>”</p>

<p>“Indeed, witchery was in it. I myself went one day
to a neighbour’s house for a young cock, and they had
a calf tied behind the door. I was not long in the
house till a girl came in. When I got the bird I went
away, and I was only a short time away when the calf
became unwell. The people of the house sent word
to a woman that was there, who had skill of witchery,
as people would be saying, asking her to come to
look at the calf. The woman came, but if (she)
came, the calf was dead before she came. As soon
as she looked on it, she said to them on the spot,
that it was the ‘Eye’ that caused the death. And
more than that, she told them who had done the
mischief (wounding). Here is how she said: ‘Have
you not had two women here sometime to-day?’
and when they answered that there had been, she
said: ‘One of them was fair and the other dark.
There was a grey shawl on the fair one, and it was
she that wrought the witchery.’ Now that was quite<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
true, for the girl that came in when I was in the
house was fair, and there was a grey shawl on her.”</p>

<p>A woman of about sixty-five, a reader of history
and Gaelic publications, remembers when the belief
in the Evil Eye was so common in Islay, that when
any disease came among a person’s cattle, it gave rise
at once to a strong suspicion that they had been
<i lang="gd">air an cronachadh</i>. The disease was called “<i lang="gd">dosgach</i>.”
When one would come with the news of disease or
death among a neighbour’s cattle, the person to
whom it was told would say, “<i lang="gd">Mach an dosgach a so</i>”;
or, “<i lang="gd">Mach a so an droch sgeul</i>” (“Away the plague
from here;” or, “Away the evil news from here.”)
At the same time, suiting the action to the words, he
would tear some piece off the clothes he had on at the
time and throw it into the fire. This was supposed
to prevent the evil from coming his way.</p>

<p>Indeed there are very many who still act on the
belief expressed in the following, by an old distillery
workman, uneducated, but naturally shrewd, though
we would say credulous: “They will be saying to
me that we have no mention of <i lang="gd">cronachadh</i> in the
Bible, and they will be putting it down my throat,
but I tell them that it is there. Both the Evil Eye
and Witchcraft were in it from the beginning, and
they will be in it till the end.”</p>

<p>We may mention here that there is a very strong
belief among many of the influence of the “wish” for
good or evil. “B. McL. affirms that if she wishes ill
to any person ill is sure to follow, and if she wishes
well good will come of it. She maintained that a
person, lately dangerously ill, owed her recovery to
her good wishes.” A person has only to maintain
this view, and the superstitious will probably find<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
reasons for believing that it is true. This, however,
opens the question of the <i lang="gd">guidhe</i> (imprecation or intercession,
as the case may be), and there are not a few
who are applied to to make <i lang="gd">guidhes</i> of both sorts.</p>

<p>We must consider the meaning of the terms used.</p>

<p>In South Argyllshire the common expression regarding
a person or thing affected is that it is <i lang="gd">air
a chronachadh</i>, or, as another in Northern Argyll expressed
it, <i lang="gd">air a chronachen</i>. <i lang="gd">Cron</i> means a fault or
defect, and the verb used seems to be an expression
of the opinion that something is wrong with the
object, the usual meaning of the word being best
translated “reproved,” or “rebuked”; the speaker, as
it were, finding some fault in the person or thing
spoken to, he <i>sees</i> that it is faulty, and says so. In
the case of a person with an Evil Eye, he actually
causes defect to the object. Now the same would
be true of black magic; thus, <i lang="gd">air a chronachadh</i> is as
apposite to a person affected by witchcraft as by the
Evil Eye. It is necessary therefore to distinguish,
when one hears of a case of <i lang="gd">cronachadh</i>, whether it
is by mischievous intention or not; and this is done
sometimes by the reciter. Thus, a person consulted
to cure an animal affected, when telling who it was
that was to blame for the evil, said: “<i lang="gd">Well, ’se duine
le ceann dubh a chronaich do bho leis an droch shuil</i>”
(“Well, it is a man with a black head that has injured
your cow, with the Evil Eye”).</p>

<p>In many districts this expression would merely
convey the idea of rebuke (Tyree, Lewis, Dornoch,
Kiltearn). In these places the expression usually is
<i lang="gd">Luidh droch shuil air</i> (An evil eye rested on him). In
Easter Ross, a person desirous of avoiding reflections
would say: “<i lang="gd">Cha’n eil mi cuir mo shuil ann</i>” (“I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
am not putting my eye in it”). Even in Arisaig in
Southern Inverness-shire, marching with Argyllshire,
they use this expression only.</p>

<p>We have already given above, from Uist, an instance
in which the speaker simply called it “the
Eye,” neither qualifying it as good or bad.</p>

<p>The rapidity of the action is sometimes expressed
thus:—A healer called in, said in one case: “<i lang="gd">Teum
do bho, a bhean</i>,” equivalent to saying, “Your cow is
bitten or stung,” the word <i lang="gd">teum</i> being also applied
to something snatched. The operation of the Evil
Eye in Uist is described by a parallel phrase, <i lang="gd">air
a ghonadh</i> (stabbed), an expression which has been
used in Kintyre as synonymous with <i lang="gd">cronachadh</i>,
though there it generally expresses pain felt either
bodily or mentally.</p>

<p>An elderly woman, a native of Duthill, Inverness-shire,
while stating that there were “plenty of people
round about us here who have got the Evil Eye and
hurt both cattle and people with it,” gave the following
as the expressions used when mentioning it:—</p>

<p><i lang="gd">Thuit droch shuil air</i> (An evil eye fell on him).</p>

<p><i lang="gd">Ghabh an droch shuil e</i> (The evil eye took him).</p>

<p><i lang="gd">Laidh droch shuil air</i> (An evil eye settled on him).</p>

<p><i lang="gd">Bhuail droch shuil e</i> (An evil eye struck him).</p>

<p>In the part of Ireland nearest to Scotland at any
rate, and so far as the writer knows also in other
places, the expression used in English is “blinked.”
The readiest conclusion come to as to what is wrong
with a sick cow is that “she has been blinked.”
Blinked milk, therefore, is milk which yields no
butter. Blinked beer, beer which has become sour.</p>

<p>All these expressions, then, of the action of <i lang="gd">an suil
dona</i>, the common expression in part of Inverness-shire,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
which, seeing “Donas” is the Devil, we might
translate the “diabolical eye,” evidently point to the
fact that a mere look will do the damage; so the remark
of the Islay man, “<i lang="gd">Ni an fheadhainn aig am bheil
an t-suil so cron air beathach neo duine ged nach dean iad
ach amhairc orra</i>” (“Those who have this eye will do
injury to beast or person, though they do nothing
but look on them”), expresses clearly what seems
to have been the original notion conveyed in the
expressions used.</p>

<p>A strange charm for the closure of the eye was
expressed in Arran by the following saying: “<i lang="gd">Cronachadh
air do shuil, cac eun air muin sin</i>” (“Ill on
your eye, birds’ excrement on the back of that”).
This was an old practice, according to the reciter,
who is a woman of about eighty. The account she
gave was as follows:—Her father had bought some
cattle at the market. “They were fine beasts, and
the servantman and I, then a young girl, were
driving them home. When we were passing King’s
Cross a man stood and looked keenly at them. The
servantman did not like this, and turning towards
him said the words recited.” They were avowedly
used to save the cattle from being hurt by the
man’s eye, and as the old lady said, “Whether
that saved them or no I could not tell, but in
any case we reached home safely and no harm
came to the cows.”</p>

<p>The Islay expression already quoted, <i lang="gd">Mach an dosgach</i>,
contains within it the suggestion of evil coming
to the unprotected, <i lang="gd">Dosgadh</i> (calamity, misfortune),
etymologically having the signification, <i lang="gd">without protection</i>.<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
Subsequently we will find that no grown<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
person need be unprotected if he will take a very
small amount of trouble.</p>

<p>Another Arran formula used in connection with the
Evil Eye, and said to be protective, was mentioned
in an account of a shepherd who lived in the island,
said to have an Evil Eye. He could hurt cattle, and
also cure the effect of the Evil Eye of another. The
reciter said he was a queer fellow, and remembers him
at the first Cattle Show ever he (reciter) attended, and
being frightened by being addressed, with other boys,
for being in his road: “<i lang="gd">Mach a sin leibh. Cha’n ann
airson an itheadh a tha iad</i>” (“Out of that with you.
They are not for eating”), said the shepherd, as he
drove his cattle. His mentioning eating recalled to
the boys’ minds his Evil Eye, and the following
formula to be repeated in cases of <i lang="gd">cronachadh</i>. “<i lang="gd">Ma
dh’itheas iad thu, gun sgeith iad thu, agus gun garbh
sgeith iad thu</i>” (“If they eat you, may they vomit
you, and roughly vomit you”). This seems to be
chaff from non-believers to believers, possibly also
the case with the formula above, more than a thing
really said with a belief in its curative power.</p>

<p>There is a considerable difference between some
wandering folklorist happening on a superstitious
survival in some ancient crone or secluded corner,
and in the general acceptation by many, if not by a
majority, of some belief regarded by the more instructed
as to be so classed.</p>

<p>The belief in the Evil Eye in the West of Scotland
comes decidedly under the latter category. Interrogatories
show that it exists in Caithness, Sutherland,
Ross-shire, Inverness-shire, Elgin, Argyll, Perthshire,
in the Lewis, Harris, both Uists, Barra, Skye, Tiree,
Islay, the Isle of Man, Arran, and Antrim in Ireland.
A wide enough field this. Of course there are many
unbelievers, of all classes nearly, though the less the
education, the more frequent the evidences of belief.
An attempt to state a proportion of believers as
against unbelievers is quite out of the question. One
witness will tell you it was common enough in his
youth, or <i>very common</i>, but in speaking of the present
day, reliable witnesses will say, perhaps, most usually
“pretty common,” or “quite common,” not unfrequently,
however, “very common,” or, as one unbeliever
said, “you hear of them often enough.” A cautious
man, when you try to get exact information as to the
potency of the belief, will answer that it is “strongly”
held by some, and of this there can be no sort of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
doubt; and it is much more common than most
people think.</p>

<p>Though we are treating of the Highlands and
Islands, it must not be supposed that the “ill e’e” is
a Highland speciality, speaking of Scotland alone, of
course. It may with perfect sincerity be said, with
all due caution, that it is “pretty common” among
Lowlanders also.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="SOCIAL_POSITION_OF_BELIEVERS">SOCIAL POSITION OF BELIEVERS</h2>
</div>


<p>The persons among whom this belief is most usual
are undoubtedly to be found principally among the
agricultural and fishing population, though it is not
unknown, by any means, even in such a town as
Oban, where a reciter of Evil Eye incidents says “it
is pretty common.” When one speaks of a farmer
in many parts of the Low Country, one naturally
thinks of well-educated men with comparatively large
holdings, and such men, of course, are to be met
with in the Highlands in appreciable numbers. There
is no evidence that these have faith in the Evil Eye;
but the smaller farmers, doing their own work with
assistance, are often deeply imbued. A native of
Kintyre says, “I know a respectable farmer who,
when anything goes wrong with his horses, is quite
in the habit of suspecting that it is injury by the
Evil Eye, and will send at once for a certain woman
in the neighbourhood, who is supposed to be able
to cure in cases of <i lang="gd">cronachadh</i>.”</p>

<p>So lately as July 1898, in one of the islands a child
was unwell. The doctor was there and the minister
was there, but still the child was getting worse. At
length the parents concluded that it was a case of
<i lang="gd">cronachadh</i>, and a man who practises as a professional
in cases of that kind was sent for. On arriving he
confirmed them in their suspicion, and told them that
it was a woman with brown hair that had done the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
harm. The reciter (a minister’s wife) did not know
what means he took to cure the child, but whatever
they were they were not successful. The child died.</p>

<p>Most of our beliefs are inherited, and so it is,
perhaps, no wonder if one comes upon a young man,
a probationer of the Church who has gone through
his curriculum of study, and yet believes in the Evil
Eye. No evidence, however, is forthcoming of a
licensed medical man having any belief in it. It
must be admitted that the greater part of the information
is got from women, and if believers were
polled, the majority would be found of the less
stern sex.</p>

<p>From the small farmer downwards, among all
owners of stock, and this includes chickens and the
pig, believers are frequent.</p>

<p>In some places there is but little secrecy as to
those who have the Evil Eye, or at least are supposed
to have it. We refrain from publishing the full
names, so that if by any chance those spoken of
see this they may not be offended; but this is a
sample of a common style of remark: “<i lang="gd">Tha, tha,
tha droch shuil aig Anna nic E. Nach robh Mrs.
MacT. ag innseadh dhomh fhein nach bu mhor nach
robh aon da clann marbh le droch shuil a’ bhoirionnach
sin uair. Bha e air a chronachadh leatha, agus bhitheadh
e marbh ach airson Anna T.</i>” (“Yes, yes, Ann McE.
has an Evil Eye. Was not Mrs. MacT. telling myself
that one of her children was once nearly dead
through the Evil Eye of that woman. He was injured
by her, and would have been dead had it not been
for Ann T.”) Ann T. was a practitioner of <i lang="gd">eolas</i>.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="DESCRIPTION_OF_POSSESSORS_OF">DESCRIPTION OF POSSESSORS OF
EVIL EYE</h2>
</div>


<p>Anybody may have the Evil Eye, but that certain
people suggest the Evil Eye to others from their
appearance must be admitted. A minister, himself
a son of the manse, who has had Highland surroundings
all his early life, bears witness, “The
possession was more frequently ascribed to females
than to males, and for the most part to elderly
women.” Another minister, an older man than the
former, says of the Evil Eye: “They were chiefly
women that were suspected, and were generally much
disliked in the communities.” These two reciters
were as far apart as Arran and Ross-shire.</p>

<p>Was the Evil Eye ascribed to them because they
were disliked, or were they disliked because they had
the Evil Eye? Women do not improve in appearance
with age, nor men either, for the matter of that,
and one of our reciters, in describing a case of
<i lang="gd">cronachadh</i>, said that the operator was “a bad-looking
woman at any rate, and had a queer look.” In
Knapdale we hear of one who was “a decent enough
looking woman, but there was this about her, people
always suspected her of having some evil power, and
nobody liked to refuse her if she asked anything.”
Another of the accused was “strange in her dress,
and spoke in an imperious manner.”</p>

<p>It is curious to note that, having quoted all the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>
descriptions of individuals we have, the criticisms
should all be levelled at women; but it must not be
supposed that men are at all exempt. The writer
was amused, and not a little astonished, to hear that
an old gentleman, a connection of his own, a large
farmer and not unknown beyond his own district,
certainly not a greedy man, and a pleasant companion,
was among some as notorious for his Evil Eye as for
his knowledge of his business. He was a Low Country
man by descent, ignorant of Gaelic, and surrounded by
Gaelic-speaking Highlanders, some of whom however,
proprietors and taxmen, were said to be as bad as
himself.</p>

<p>The only diagnostic mark that has been mentioned,
physically demonstrating a possessor, was got from an
Islay woman, who said that she had always heard
that a person whose eyes are of a different colour has
the Evil Eye. This seems explicable enough; if one
were a nice bright blue eye or a deep and gentle
brown one, and the other paler and less expressive,
their best friends might say that they had a “bad eye.”
All the parti-coloured eyes in Scotland would not
account for a tenth part of the results accredited to
evil eyes.</p>

<p>Small are the changes in the ideas of men in some
respects, even after long intervals.</p>

<p>In the old Irish saga, entitled the <i>Sack of Da
Derga’s Hostel</i>, describing events which occurred,
according to the Irish analysts, either <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 31, or
<span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 43:<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> “When they were there they saw a lone
woman coming to the door of the hostel, after sunset,
and seeking to be let in. As long as a weaver’s
beam was each of her two shins, and they were as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
dark as the back of a stag-beetle. A greyish, woolly
mantle she wore. Her lower hair used to reach as
far as her knee. Her lips were on one side of her
head. She came and put one of her shoulders against
the door-post of the house, casting the Evil Eye on
the King and the youths who surrounded him in
the hostel.”<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p><a id="Footnote_5" href="#FNanchor_5" class="label">[5]</a> Whitley Stokes, <i>Revue Celtique</i>, xxii. pp. 57-59. The existing redaction

</div>

<p>The Gaelic word translated by Stokes here “casting
the Evil Eye” is in the original Gaelic “<i lang="gd">oc admilliud
ind rig</i>,” literally to this day “hurting or spoiling the
king,” <i lang="gd">cronachadh</i>, in fact. It says nothing of incantations
or magical observances, and the translation
given seems thoroughly justified. The description of
Cailb, Samon, Sinand (she was the possessor of
many names), of course imaginatively exaggerates her
ugliness, but her evil looks, with her black fire-burned
shins, is just what one would expect to hear of an
old woman credited with the Evil Eye nowadays,
though it is not now common to expose so much leg
as to show the effect of toasting it at the fire.</p>

<p>One can easily fancy that the warriors of Ireland
would have no pleasure in encountering Cailb. A like
objection is common in the present day in regard to
persons with an Evil Eye.</p>

<p>A Western Islander says: “People would be
blaming J. B., but there was one worse than her.
Nobody who ever met M. McA. when on his way to
fish, would go on, for it was believed that no fish
would be got after meeting her.” The reciter himself
and another man were on their way to fish when
they met this woman. The other suggested that there
was no use going now, for they would not get anything,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
that was sure. The reciter said that he grudged
turning back, although he believed his companion
was right; but not to waste time, and to avoid the
chance of other mischief, they both returned home.</p>

<p>“J. McE. was said to have the Evil Eye, and no
one liked to meet her if they were going on important
business, especially to fish; some would even turn
back if they met her.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="OBJECTION_TO_MEETING_AN">OBJECTION TO MEETING AN
EVIL EYE</h2>
</div>


<p>Another informant, speaking of a woman with an
Evil Eye and who consequently was unlucky to
meet, said: “Three fishermen met her, and one of
them proposed that they should turn back; it was
no use going on, they would get nothing. The
others persisted and overruled him. They were for
a while unsuccessful, and he who had proposed returning
was very impatient, and kept grumbling and
saying they should have returned home. They did
catch a few at last.”</p>

<p>Speaking of those who were supposed to take the
milk and butter from other people’s cows, an educated
Arran man said: “This class were looked upon as
being unlucky to meet on the road, and people tried
to avoid them, especially if they were going on any
particular business.”</p>

<p>One would suppose that it would be exceedingly
unpleasant to have the reputation of an Evil Eye,
consequently it is resented, but precautions are taken
sometimes, even before the accusation is made, to
hinder the report arising about individuals. In one
village, where twice a week a number of fishermen
pass, the women and girls of the village try to keep
out of sight of the men on their way to the fishing-ground,
lest, if by chance a fisher should see one
of them and he was unlucky immediately thereafter,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
he would report to the rest his want of luck and
whom he had met, and she would be marked as
one of the unlucky.</p>

<p>The reciter of this was an intelligent domestic
servant, twenty-four years old, a reliable girl, brought
up by respectable grandparents.</p>

<p>A Kintyre reciter, an educated woman of about
thirty, informs us of a woman, a believer in the Evil
Eye, living beside her father, and who does not
conceal the fact that she looks with some suspicion
upon certain of her acquaintances should they come
her way, particularly should she be engaged in churning.
Her neighbours, knowing this, are careful to
avoid going to her house if she has a churning on
hand. Suspected persons do not learn their own
infirmity merely by being looked at askance.</p>

<p>A clergyman in one of the southern islands informs
us: “It is said that in cases where injury has
been done by the Evil Eye, a remedy is to charge
the suspected party firmly and distinctly to his (or
her) face with having done it. When a little boy, a
cow belonging to his grandmother had lately calved,
and a neighbour woman came one day and went to
see the cow. She was considered to be a respectable
person, even a good woman, but was believed to
possess the Evil Eye. She was no time away when
the cow became very unwell, although there had
been nothing wrong with her up till then. There
was considerable excitement, and they were sure that
the cow would die, and just as sure it was the woman’s
Evil Eye that had injured her. Another woman was
sent for, supposed to be knowing in these matters,
and the case submitted to her. She confirmed them
in their suspicions, and advised, as the best remedy,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
that she who had done the mischief should be confronted
and plainly told to her face that they believed
her to be to blame. This was agreed to and carried
out at once, with the result, as it was believed, that
whatever power she had obtained over the cow to
hurt her was broken, and in a very short time the
cow was as well as she had ever been.”</p>

<p>An Arran woman tells us the same thing in some
detail, but she says the injury can only be repaired
by the doer of the mischief taking upon himself the
evil done to the other, and illustrates it by the following
story:—A tramp who was supposed to have a
bad eye, and even suspected of witchcraft, made a
request to Mrs. Mac—— which she refused. The
woman being angered, left in a rage. She was no
time away when they noticed that there was something
wrong with the child, and when the husband
came from his work his wife told him of the woman
having been there, and her belief that she had injured
their child. The man said the woman was still in
the neighbourhood, and he would bring her back.
He did so. They then charged her to her face with
having hurt the child, and said she must now heal
her. The woman did not try to deny this, but said:
“<i lang="gd">Tha e gle chruaidh gum feumainnsa an cron a rinn
mi air an leanabh agaibh a ghabhail orm fein, ach na’n
d’thug sibhse bonn airgeid dhomhsa an ait’ an olann a
thug sibh dhomh, cha do thachair so do’n leanabh</i>”
(“It’s very hard that I should require to take on
myself the injury I have done your child, but if you
had given me a silver coin instead of the wool you
gave me, this had not happened to the child”).</p>

<p>She had to cure the child, however. What had
happened to it was that its mouth kept always open,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
and it could not catch the breast. The reciter did
not say that the malady of the open mouth stuck to
the woman, but being somewhat notorious, and a
different incident being told of her by another reciter,
the latter remarked that “she had an ungainly face,
and that if ever there was a witch in Arran, he
thought that woman would pass for one.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="AVOIDING_SUSPICION_OF_EVIL_EYE">AVOIDING SUSPICION OF EVIL EYE</h2>
</div>


<p>People have not always the candour to accuse the
suspected.</p>

<p>A lady engaged in teaching gives the following
information: “You would hear of Mrs. McG.? She
is making a great noise because, as she says, the milk
is being taken from her cow, and not long ago her
horse and some other beast of hers died, and she
thinks it is because they were <i lang="gd">air an cronachadh</i> by
some person. She blamed a girl that was keeping
house with a neighbour, and she went to the girl’s
sister and said to her to say to her sister not to be
taking away the milk from her cow.” This was not
supposed to be a case of witchcraft.</p>

<p>So far we have been dealing with women, but
it must not be supposed that such accusations are
rarely made against men.</p>

<p>A small farmer, Alexander ——, having got into
difficulties, lost his farm. A neighbour, better able
to stock it, entered into possession. Soon, however,
a cow died, and it was concluded that it was a case
of <i lang="gd">cronachadh</i>, an opinion in which its owner agreed,
declaring: “<i lang="gd">Well, cho fad’s bhios bo bheo agam, cha
dean mise rithist namhaid de Alasdair</i>” (“Well, as
long as I have a living cow I will not again make
an enemy of Alexander”).</p>

<p>Men are also as cautious to avoid suspicion as
women. Recently a servant-girl in Islay, having<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>
the charge of attending to the feeding of a pig,
requested a man who had never been suspected of
possessing a hurtful eye to look at the pig to see
how it was thriving. The man refused, adding quite
seriously that he did not like to look at a beast
that way, in case of any harm being done. When
she persisted that there could be no harm, he replied
that not long ago M. McL. had a litter of young
pigs, and a man came that way and was looking at
them one evening, and the next morning they were
all dead.</p>

<p>The reasons ascribed for the action of some are
doubtless influenced by the reciter’s own beliefs.
Thus, it was often said of a gentleman farmer in
Rothiemurchus, well known in the countryside, that
he would never praise any beast of his own, and
this was supposed to be owing to his belief that
he himself had an Evil Eye. It does not seem to
have occurred to his neighbours that it was native
modesty.</p>

<p>To show the hold that belief in an Evil Eye has
on certain minds, a native of Ross-shire tells how
he went to see a neighbour, who asked his assistance
in putting a ring in the nose of a pig to prevent it
rooting. “There was another neighbour of his there
too, who had come forward when he saw us, one
W. M., an intelligent man, and one that I would never
have thought would give in to these superstitions;
but he was a man that believed in the Evil Eye,
although nobody suspected him of having it himself.”
Accidentally the pig’s leg was broken. It was understood
to belong to the wife of the man who proposed
to ring it, who said:—</p>

<p>“Man, what will we say to the wife? But come<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
away in and see what she has got to say.” When
we went in the wife asked us if we had got the ring
in the pig, and her man answered, “No, and I am
sorry to tell you the pig has broken her leg.”</p>

<p>“How did that happen?” she asked, and her
husband said, out of pure fun, “Oh, I don’t know,
unless W. M.’s eye has fallen upon her.” That was
enough. Up W. got in a wild rage, and said he
would not sit under such a suspicion, and off he
marched, terribly offended.</p>

<p>At the time of writing a reciter, a woman, admits
that at K. in A. a man is living whom his neighbours
believe to have the Evil Eye, and people not only
do not like to meet him, but go out of their way
to avoid him when going on important matters. It
is told of him that a donkey belonging to a woman
kicked his horse. The donkey’s owner expressed a
hope that he would not come to know of it, lest he
should hurt her beast. Her fear was justified, as
it turned out, for the man saw the donkey kick the
horse, and however he managed it, people believed
that he put <i lang="gd">cronachadh</i> on the donkey, for it turned
ill and shortly died.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="ACTION_OF_EVIL_EYE_INDEPENDENT">ACTION OF EVIL EYE INDEPENDENT
OF POSSESSOR</h2>
</div>


<p>It must be difficult, one would think, for any reasonably
kindly-intentioned person to accept as proved
that they had an Evil Eye. But a distinction is made
between possessing an Evil Eye and doing mischief
with it. A native of Glen Urquhart, Inverness-shire,
among others says that there it is understood a person
may possess an Evil Eye and do mischief with it
without intending it, and without knowing that he
has done it. When a person knows that he has an
Evil Eye, and does mischief with it intentionally, the
ill-doing is usually supposed to be more or less
connected with witchcraft.</p>

<p>Many believe the injury from the Evil Eye is quite
independent of the will of the possessor. A farmer,
a believer, said: “When we were in the old place
more than thirty years ago, there was a man living
upon the hill who would often be helping the farmers
round about when they were throng. He had the
Evil Eye; but he could not help it. He would be
sorry for it himself; many a one would be scolding
him for hurting their beasts.”</p>

<p>Another says: “<i lang="gd">Cronachadh</i> is still in it, and
those that have got the Evil Eye cannot help it. They
sometimes do harm with their eye when they do not
intend it, and even when they do not know that they
are doing it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span></p>

<p>This seems a thoroughly rooted idea in Islay, and
a Tiree man informs us that there it is also thought
that injury by an Evil Eye is involuntary on the part
of the person who has such an eye, and not necessarily
malicious or intended.</p>

<p>This is also met with as a belief in Arran, and a
reciter there tells of a minister in the Parish of
Kilmory who had the Evil Eye in spite of himself,
and if he looked on his own cattle or horses they
were sure to be ill after. Other cases are mentioned,
and one of our reciters told how a man, while resident
in the south of the island, and fond of fine cattle, in
the place where he was well known and respected
had never been suspected of the Evil Eye, but removing
to the Whiting Bay district, where he was
among strangers, suspicion of the Evil Eye attached
to him and remained with him to the day of his
death.</p>

<p>In these two last cases, in speculating upon the
cause of the accusation, it seems quite probable that
the minister, being occupied with his own special
duties, rarely regarded the state of his beasts, and
only took notice of them under exceptional circumstances,
and coincidence had connected his inspection
of them and their illnesses. The other evidently was
an amateur with an eye to beauty in others’ cattle, and
probably had unfortunately expressed approval before
subsequent misfortune. One notorious incident was
undoubtedly enough to set the report going, and all
know the results of giving a lie half-an-hour’s start.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="EVIL_EYE_TAKES_EFFECT_EVEN_ON">EVIL EYE TAKES EFFECT EVEN ON
THINGS NOT SEEN</h2>
</div>


<p>There is one simple way of keeping your property
safe from the Evil Eye: viz., by not letting it be
known that you have what may be affected. A
certain D. MacF., who knew that his neighbour was
crediting his Evil Eye with having spoiled a churning,
was standing in the back-yard when the woman who
suspected him was milking her cow. She, having
finished, should have passed him with her milk to
carry it in by the door, but on seeing him she started,
and instead of coming forward, passed the pitcher of
milk in by a little window on the back wall of the
house, and then walked forward and went in at the
door, passing MacF. He concluded that her object
was to keep the milk out of his sight lest he should
hurt it. MacF. disavows the possession of any power
of the kind.</p>

<p>Another reciter mentions that a certain Calum
Ban, having the name of the Evil Eye, others kept
things out of his sight for fear that he might hurt
them.</p>

<p>The mere preventing the eye resting on the thing
to be affected would, however, have been quite insufficient,
according to one reciter, a native of Bernera
(Harris). She told of one, recognised as possessing
an Evil Eye, that he was sure to covet everything
in the possession of his neighbours, and consequently<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
“those nearest R. were very unfortunate.”
His influence was understood to extend beyond
what he actually saw, and therefore even hearing
about things was kept from him. On one occasion
the young daughter of R.’s neighbour set eggs under
two hens, and being considered “lucky,” having
usually been successful, she expected two good
broods. In the interval she mentioned what she
had done in the hearing of R.’s daughter. When
the time came not a single chicken appeared out
of the two settings. Her mother then said she
would put eggs below the hens, but warned all in
the house to be sure and not tell that they were
there. This was done, the hens being kept carefully
concealed, and full and thriving broods were got.</p>

<p>An old man now dead, a crofter who could read,
who was strongly superstitious, telling his stories
with great gusto, and reliable, is the authority for
the following, which shows how the superstitions
of others were played on. In the time when ploughs
were made of wood of a home manufacture, the
farmer in Octofad brought home a new one. One
day, using the new plough, coming round at the
end of a furrow, the plough was broken in two.
The man between the stilts and the man leading
the horses threw the blame of the carelessness on
one another. At last the latter proposed that if the
ploughman would leave to him to tell the old man
(the farmer) how it happened, and if he would not
say a word at all in the matter, he believed that he
would be able to put it past (<i lang="gd">a chuir seachad</i>) right
enough. The ploughman agreed. They took the
horses home, and when the farmer made his appearance
looking displeased (<i lang="gd">coslas gu math crosda air</i>),<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>
the lad began his tale. “<i lang="gd">De ach am beist duine sin
tha ann C. aig am bheil an droch shuil. Thainig e an
rathad far an robh sin a treabhadh, agus on a bhios
a shuil aige anns gach ni a chi e, thoisich e air a bhi
moladh nan each agus a chrann; agus cha robh e tiota
air falbh, nuair a chaidh a’ chrann ann an da leth.</i>”
(“What but that beast of a man that is in C., who has
the Evil Eye. He came the way where we were
ploughing, and since he will have his eye in everything
he sees, he began praising the horses and the
plough, and he was no time gone when the plough
went in two halves.”)</p>

<p>The lad’s forecast was correct. His master’s eye
lost its gloom, and shaking his hand to them, he said:
“Never mind, never mind; put in the horses, and
do not say a word about it to anybody in case he
may do more harm. If the horses are safe, we will
not be long in dressing the plough.”</p>

<p>It is perfectly clear that an interesting instance
of the influence of the Evil Eye was established here,
so far as the farmer was concerned, and doubtless
the belief in it generally owes not a little to equally
fanciful stories.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="MORAL_SOURCE_OF_THE_EVIL_EYE">MORAL SOURCE OF THE EVIL EYE</h2>
</div>


<p>Though the action of the Evil Eye is accepted as
involuntary, in the majority of cases, this is not the
accepted doctrine in all districts. From Ross-shire
(Strathpeffer) a reciter says:—</p>

<p>“It is a power which they are in some cases
supposed to exercise involuntarily, but oftener intentionally
and with mischievous design.”</p>

<p>From somewhat the same locality, Dores (near
Inverness), a reciter “thinks that the involuntary
kind that is often met with in certain other parts of
the Highlands is not recognised, but in every case
in which injury arises from an Evil Eye, it is to be
referred to active covetousness and greed of gain at
other people’s expense.” But even in Kintyre, where
the involuntary action is accepted, a native tells us:
“I believe in what people call the Evil Eye, and
I have known very many who believed in it just as
much as I do; not that every man has it, for there
are only some that I would be afraid of. If I see
a man that thinks highly of what belongs to himself,
and would not exchange it with any man, that is
the man I would like to have dealings with, for
although he might do injury to himself, or to any
living thing he might possess, he would do no harm
to another. If I saw a man envying everything he
saw, and thinking what belonged to other people
was better than what belonged to himself, I would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>
be afraid of that man, and if I had cattle I would
not like him to come among them, for if he came
I would be sure something would happen.”</p>

<p>A Mull woman said: “<i lang="gd">Cronachadh</i> is quite common.
It is done usually by a person that has an
Evil Eye. It is just an eye with great greed and
envy.”</p>

<p>An Islay man says: “<i lang="gd">Tha cronachadh ann. Se ‘n
droch cridhe tha dol thun na sul, agus a’ deanadh droch
suil.</i>” (“<i lang="gd">Cronachadh</i> exists. It is the evil heart going
to the eye and causing an Evil Eye.”) The suggestion
thus is that an Evil Eye is but the result of the natural
man who has not rooted out of his nature what is
forbidden in the Tenth Commandment, and so a
native of Ross-shire (Tarbat) shows how strong the
belief was that mischief might come “through the
Evil Eye or ill wish of another.” A certain aunt of
his formed a strong dislike to him when he was a
boy, simply because it was known that his grandfather
favoured him to the disadvantage of this aunt, as she
thought, and he well remembered how anxious his
mother was for a long time, lest the aunt’s known ill-will
should cause some blight to come on him.</p>

<p>The following from Islay shows that though the
belief there that it is involuntary is strongly held,
those who have the power may exercise it deliberately.
“There was a woman in Islay who had a sow
that had a litter of young pigs. One morning a
neighbour came to her, and seeing the teapot at the
fire, asked if she would give her a drop of the tea.
This was given to her. She then said, ‘You have
fine young pigs there.’ ‘Yes, but they are all sold,’
answered the other. With that the visitor turned
towards the door to go, and said, ‘Well, you sold a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>
pig to me that died.’ That was all that passed, and
she went her way; but the following morning two
of the pigs were dead, and the owner was quite certain
that the woman had done the mischief. The reciter
who gives the information is of the same opinion, and
he adds that it was an unkind thing to do on a poor
woman.”</p>

<p>The strength of the Evil Eye, according to some,
is to be gauged by the following remark by an old
man: “<i lang="gd">B’abhaist gu’m biodh e air a radh le sean
daoine, gun sgoilteadh an t-suil sanntach eadhon na
creagan fein o cheile.</i>” (“It used to be said by old
people that the greedy eye would split asunder the
very rocks.”)</p>

<p>Another says <i lang="gd">cronachadh</i> is just envy, and it is
said that envy will break the very stones. A man
who wishes to have everything for himself will do
harm to whatever he sees.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="THINGS_THAT_SPECIALLY_ATTRACT">THINGS THAT SPECIALLY ATTRACT</h2>
</div>


<p>A woman of twenty-eight, whose information is quite
reliable, the daughter of a respectable man in one
of the inner islands, remembers when young people
talked a great deal about these things, and many were
very much afraid of them. “The idea was that it
was always the best and prettiest of beast or body
that was most liable to be injured by a bad eye.
Her youngest brother was awfully pretty when a child.
They used to have him dressed in a red frock and
white pinny, and with his fair skin, fair curly hair,
and red cheeks, he was the nicest-looking child in
all the place. Many a time, when my father would
take him out, the neighbours would be warning him
to take good care lest some one might do the child
harm, and some would advise my father to go in and
take the frock and pinny off him, so that he might not
draw one’s attention so much.”</p>

<p>From Ross-shire we hear the same thing. A
native “remembers when he was young, people believed
in the Evil Eye and were afraid of it.” It
was supposed that pretty children were specially
liable to be injured by it, and it was a common
device with some mothers, in circumstances where
there was any suspicion of danger, to take care that
at least some article of the child’s dress would be at
fault, either in respect of neatness or cleanness, or
better still, to have one of the child’s stockings turned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
outside in when being worn. These were supposed
to form a protection to the child against injury.</p>

<p>The reciter remembers quite well a woman who
in her own person and house was the pink of neatness,
but full of superstition, and he cannot remember
ever having seen her children without something untidy
about them. Always a stocking or something
else wrong on, and this was done intentionally by
their mother to keep away the Evil Eye.</p>

<p>A native of Bernera (Harris) testified: “When a
person appears well dressed and good-looking, it is
supposed that she is in danger of being affected by
the Evil Eye. A recommendation in such a case is
to wear some article of clothing with the wrong side
out, as a preventative of harm.”</p>

<p>An old man of eighty-seven, uneducated, but full
of information, somewhat difficult to understand from
the loss of his teeth and the weakness of his voice,
telling his experiences in the most pathetic manner,
said: “<i lang="gd">Bu nighean a’ cheud duine cloinne bha riomh
agam, agus bha deigh mhor agam oirre. Ach de
thachair, ach latha bha ‘n sin, bha i amach aig taobh an
tighe, agus bha neach a’ dol seachad aig an robh droch
shuil, agus chaidh an droch shuil anns an leanabh, agus
bha i air a chronachadh. O’n am sin chaidh an creatur
air a h-ais co mor gus aig a cheann mu dheireadh cha
robh i air a cumail beo ach le beagan fion a bha air a
chuir ann a beul le spain ti.</i>” (“The first one of my
family was a daughter. She was a pretty child, and
I was very fond of her. But what happened but a
day that was there, she was out at the side of the
house and a person passed who had an Evil Eye,
and the Evil Eye went into the child and she was
injured. From that time the creature went back so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>
much, until at last she was only kept alive by a little
wine put into her mouth with a teaspoon.”)</p>

<p>“When people had occasion to go to farmer R.’s
house, having children with them, they contrived to
put some attractive article of clothing on the children,
so that the gay clothes might divert his eye from the
wearers and save them from injury.”</p>

<p>A native of Knockando (Elgin) says that there is
an impression that the young, either of man or beast,
are very liable to receive injury from an Evil Eye
fastening upon them, if that should be the first eye
that sees them after their birth. This belief makes
people take great care often to secure that any one
supposed to possess an Evil Eye will not be the first
to see an infant immediately after birth, or any other
young animal.</p>

<p>Using short texts separated from the context leads
undoubtedly to misapprehensions on the part of the
unlearned. In Isaiah xiii. 18, he says of the Medes,
alluding to physical injury alone, “their eye shall
not spare children.” That text has influenced not
a few.</p>

<p>Without any suspicion of the owner of a beast
having the Evil Eye himself, his desire to retain it
is supposed to render it specially liable to the evil
influence of any one possessed of the power. A Kinlochbervie
man remembers well how very common,
in his youth, was belief in the Evil Eye, and vividly
recalls the terror his mother had when any unknown
vagrant came the way, lest, being possessed of an
Evil Eye, he might leave a blight on the house or
anything belonging to it. She would give almost
anything they might ask so as to get them away
in a good mood.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="STRANGERS_SPECIALL_LIABLE">STRANGERS SPECIALLY LIABLE TO BE
ACCUSED OF THE POSSESSION OF THE EVIL EYE</h2></div>


<p>Acquaintances might be divided into two classes.
The Evil Eyes and the Non-Evil Eyes. Precautions
should be taken against the former, and with them
it was safe to class strangers. The daughter of a
tradesman, a clever, intelligent woman, a farmer’s wife,
whose husband’s people and her own mother are
very superstitious, having moved from one district
to another, her new neighbours, not long after she
had came to live beside them, lost a number of geese.
The owners made a great “ado,” and the position
they took up relative to our reciter, the suspected
one, was: “<i lang="gd">Faicibh fein an droch shuil tha aice. Cha
deachaidh na geoidh air seachran riomh roimhe, ach
ghabh iad fuath ‘nuair a’ dh’ amhairc ise orra.</i>” (“See
for yourself the Evil Eye she had; the geese never
before wandered, but took fright when she looked
at them.”)</p>

<p>The owners of these geese seem to have had a very
lively faith in the Evil Eye. The collector having
mentioned the experience to another neighbour, she
said: “That’s not so bad as I got. I went to inquire
for a friend if they would sell a goose. They said
they would not sell, and there was no harm in that;
but shortly after all the geese flew away, and if I did
not catch it. They were in a fearful rage, blaming<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>
me for putting my Evil Eye in them. Another time
their hens ceased laying, and they blamed my eye for
that also.”</p>

<p>It is scarcely to be wondered at, the jealous ascription
of the Evil Eye to strangers, though Highland
publications speak largely of the noble characteristics
of Highlanders at large, and the writer is the last
man to deny them credit due. It must be confessed
there is a large quantity of a ‘parochial’ feeling of
jealousy in the Highlands generally. It is not
necessary to go into the question whether this is or
is not the modern aspect of previous district quarrels.
Tramps trade upon this fear of strangers in other
Gaelic places than the Scottish Highlands. A minister
relates the following, which came under his own
observation in Antrim. A tramp was passing a
house, and he went and asked the housewife for a
drink of milk. She said she had no milk, but the
tramp was sure she had, but did not want to part
with it. He said, “Oh, very well, I’ll take a drink
of water, and let what will happen to the cows.”
This was enough; she was sure that this was a
challenge that he would have the milk in spite of
her, so she repented and gave him as good a drink
of milk as he could wish for, no doubt in this way
escaping evil consequences.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="PEOPLE_SHOULD_GIVE_WHEN_ASKED">PEOPLE SHOULD GIVE WHEN ASKED</h2>
</div>


<p>The danger of refusing a request is great, not so
much from the purely Christian-charity point of
view, as from that of escaping the Evil Eye. A native
of Knapdale, a believer, tells of a woman notorious
in that neighbourhood. She went to a farmer for
a barrel of potatoes, which he refused her. No more
was said, but she had not long gone when the best
horse he had fell down and could not rise. It was
foaming at the mouth. A man skilled in counteracting
the Evil Eye was consulted, and declared that the
horse had been injured by it. Having been informed
by the farmer that he had refused to give a barrel
of potatoes to the woman, he said it was that that
had done the harm. His advice was a little peculiar,
not in that he recommended the sending the potatoes
to the woman, but that they should be sent on the
injured horse, with evidently a view to its cure. The
potatoes were got into a bag, the bag lifted on the
horse’s back, and away it went quite briskly, and
they were delivered at the woman’s house, and thereafter
the horse was quite well.</p>

<p>Drovers are not, of course, complete strangers in
the districts in which they do business, but as a class
they are looked on with some suspicion. Thus we
are told, “Some drovers are possessed of the Evil
Eye, and in consequence it is reckoned foolish not
to sell any animals to them if they appear anxious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>
to have them.” The reciter’s father had a good cow,
and some drovers coming about wanted to buy her.
His father refused to sell. The drovers persisted, but
still met with a refusal. At last the drovers left, but
shortly after the cow sickened, died, and nothing
remained of her value to the owner but her skin.</p>

<p>A parallel case was mentioned as happening in
Islay. “I remember it was a few days before the
market a man came the way and wanted to buy a
beast from A. McI. The drover was very anxious to
get it, but they would not sell. The drover left, and
before the sun went down that evening that beast
was dead and buried. The reciter of this, a man of
about fifty and a good workman, living by himself,
is a piper, and possibly the addition of the beast’s
hurried burial may be the result of a natural tendency
to ‘blow,’ as they say. Anyhow, the piper said that
it was believed that it was the drover’s eye that had
killed the cow.”</p>

<p>Another reciter tells that a farmer in Islay had two
good horses which some dealers wished to buy. The
farmer would not sell either, and the following day
one of them died. It was believed to be a case of
Evil Eye.</p>

<p>The risk of refusing purchasers is not solely in
the case of drovers. “Many are of opinion that it is
risky for a person to refuse to sell any animal he may
have to any one who shows a great desire to purchase
it; some would sell at a sacrifice rather than run the
risk. A native of Killean, Kintyre, tells of a fine cow
his father had, and on which the family set a considerable
value. A man who had known something
about the cow came all the way from Campbeltown
purposely to buy her, but the owner declined to sell<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>
her. “If he did, he hardly got any good of her thereafter,
for in a short time she became unwell, and
lingering for a time, died. The neighbours thought
it was a real case of Evil Eye.”</p>

<p>From the mainland of Argyllshire a lady relates:
“An uncle had a farm five miles from Oban. A
neighbour on his way to attend a funeral, thinking her
uncle might drive along with him, called. As he was
passing the cow-fold the calves were being let out to
their mothers, and one of the cows had a beautiful
calf. The neighbour fixed his eyes on them and kept
looking at and admiring them. He then asked her
uncle if he would sell him the calf, but the proprietor
refused, saying he did not intend to sell either cow
or calf. That very week the calf was dead, and they
never doubted but that it was the man’s Evil Eye
that had killed it.”</p>

<p>A native of Applecross in Ross-shire told he had
bought a fine horse, but before the purchase another
man had been looking at it and been very anxious to
have it, and praised it as a splendid beast. It was
not long in the reciter’s possession until it had some
complaint from which it died. The people—the reciter
does not himself say he shares the feeling—believe
that it was killed by the Evil Eye, for it had been
known to everybody how anxious the disappointed
man had been to get it, and how highly he had
spoken of it.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="SYMPTOMS_IN_ANIMALS_ASCRIBED_TO">SYMPTOMS IN ANIMALS ASCRIBED TO
EFFECT OF EVIL EYE</h2>
</div>


<p>One naturally asks what are the symptoms which,
when present in animals, have given rise to the supposition
that they were affected by the Evil Eye.</p>

<p>A woman gives the following account of what
happened to her mother. She had been married very
young, and was sitting by the fire suckling her first
child with her breasts bare. The child had fallen
asleep on her left arm. “My mother heard something
behind her, and when she turned her head, there was a
tall, grey-haired, ill-favoured-looking woman standing.
My mother got up hurriedly, and having a great deal
of milk, the milk spouted from her right breast into
the fire. The <i lang="gd">cailleach</i> gave an unpleasant laugh and
said, ‘The milk has gone along with the pee.’ My
mother answered pleasantly enough, ‘Oh no, the
milk and pee will be all right,’ and gave the <i lang="gd">cailleach</i>
what she wanted. She was a Tiree <i lang="gd">cailleach</i>, and they
were all looked upon as being bad ones. The next
time my mother was going to give her baby a drink
she found she had not a drop of milk for him. The
baby was crying, and when he would cry she would
cry too, and what was to be done? This state of
things lasted for a day, and my father then went for
assistance from a person supposed to be skilled.”</p>

<p>The expression used by the Tiree woman was understood
by the reciter to mean the milk that should<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>
have nourished the child was to turn into water in
the mother’s system, and be so discharged.</p>

<p>Yawning has been ascribed to the effect of the
Evil Eye.</p>

<p>An Islay man said: “<i lang="gd">Bha piuthair aig an te nach
maireann agus bha i cho boidheach ’sa chunnaic sibh riomh.
Aon uair thainig boireannach a stigh agus thoiseach i air
a chaileag a mholadh gu ro mhor. Well, cha robh a
bhean sin ach gann air dol amach nur a thoiseach a
chaileag air meunanaich, agus cha robh fad gus an robh
i cho dona agus gun robh iad a saoilsinn gum bitheadh i
air falbh.</i>”</p>

<p>(“My late wife had a sister, and she was as pretty
as ever you saw. Once a woman came in and commenced
praising the girl excessively. Well, scarcely
was that woman gone out of the house when the girl
began to yawn, and it was not long till she was so bad
that they thought that she would be away (die).”)</p>

<p>In the case of a child which was quite quiet and looking
well, with the mother sitting nursing it, a neighbouring
woman, who is not much liked in the place, came in.
She sat a little while, and was no time away until the
child began to cry. It cried long and bitterly, and
its mother got into a fearful state, protesting of the
other woman: “<i lang="gd">Co fior’s tha mi beo, chronaich i mo
phaisde</i>” (“As true as I am alive she injured my
child”). It is interesting to note that in this case “a
little white powder” prescribed by a qualified practitioner
counteracted that Evil Eye.</p>

<p>Another case in which a child was ill was told as
follows:—A woman went to inquire after a man who
had just lost his wife in the Low Country, and brought
their child home to his relations. She was told that
the child was “not but poorly.” “What is the matter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>
with him?” I asked. My informant answered me,
that his mother had been sitting at the fire and the
child in her bosom, when two women came to ask for
the child’s father. The child was quite well and brisk
when they came in, but before they went away he
began to cry and groan. “He was quite sure,” he said,
“that one or other of them had injured the child, but
why they should do that he did not know, for they
both had families of their own.” This case was cured
by an unlicensed practitioner.</p>

<p>The following is from a woman of her own experience
in the case of her own son. She told that
his sister went out with him one day to a neighbour’s
house. He was sitting in her lap, when the neighbour’s
daughter called her mother’s attention to the
white beauty of the child’s legs. The mother agreed,
and something more was said praising the child, and
he then got a drink of milk. Well, as soon as he
took the milk, he began as if he were singing, “Do
re do, do re do.” This he continued to do for a good
while, and was very fretful. This child was cured by
a magic thread which stopped the “humming.”</p>

<p>Cattle, in popular belief, are much more liable
to damage from the Evil Eye than other animals,
judging from the greater number of instances related
of it in their case. “Two of M. McN.’s cattle died
within a short time of each other, and all the old
people of the place persisted in saying they were
injured by some Evil Eye.” A reciter told of her
mother, who had married the elder of two brothers
occupying a farm in common, getting the credit of
the Evil Eye because, shortly after her marriage, the
cattle on the farm “began to die right away.”</p>

<p>In the following case motive is given, and if any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>
overt act of a magical nature had been said to occur,
it would certainly have to be classified as witchcraft,
but seeing there is no such history, it is one of those
cases in which the action of an Evil Eye was evidently
not supposed to be involuntary. The heir to
a tenant who had fallen into arrears, having paid
what was owing, got possession from the superior.
Meanwhile a woman had been living in the house.
She was warned to leave, but paid no heed to the
warning, and it became necessary to turn her out
by force. She got shelter from a relative near by,
while the new tenant went to live in the house from
which she had been ejected. “But if he did, he
soon suffered for it, for he was not long there until
he had lost nine of his cattle by death, and he and
every one else believed that they had been “<i lang="gd">air an
cronachadh</i>” by the woman from spite.</p>

<p>There are no symptoms recounted in these general
losses.</p>

<p>More rarely than of cows, we hear of stirks being
affected. This is rather an old story, and the authority
for this is the reciter’s father, who told it of his
own father. He was at market in Stratherrick, and
refused to part, after considerable bargaining, with
a stirk he had to a would-be buyer. “Before the
market-day closed, down fell the stirk on the ground
and nothing could make it get up.”</p>

<p>In a quite recent case, however, a stirk, said to be
affected by the Evil Eye, “was very ill; its horns
were quite cold, and it could not eat anything. The
beast recovered.”</p>

<p>By far most commonly, evil from a “bad eye”
comes to cows. A reciter tells of an instance that
occurred to himself, where in a farm previously occupied,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>
his mother had a particularly good cow. “One
day my sister was in a neighbour’s house, and she
was telling the woman about the lot of milk this
cow had. The next day when my mother went out
at the usual hour to milk the cow, she had scarcely
begun when this woman passed close to where she
was milking. Well, not a drop of milk could my
mother get from that cow. The cow became suddenly
unwell and fell to the ground. The skin came
off her udder and not a bit of skin was on it after
that. There was not the least doubt but that it was
the other woman that had injured her.”</p>

<p>A native of Skye, in whose younger days the belief
in the Evil Eye was very common there, and who
remembers seeing “a general turn up” in the township
in which she was brought up, caused by the
alleged effect of one person’s Evil Eye upon the
cattle of the neighbours, tells how her father had a
fine Ayrshire cow. She was such a good milker that
it was necessary to milk her three times every day.
“All of a sudden her milk left her, and they never
could account for it, except on the supposition of the
action of an Evil Eye, and in fact were quite sure
that this was the case.”</p>

<p>The reciter of the following says she remembers
a Sutherlandshire minister telling it to her mother.
He said that one time his cows were not giving the
right milk. The milk was more like water than milk,
and as for butter, not a bit could he get, no matter
how well it might be churned. The minister here,
on the advice of his housekeeper, resorted to witchcraft
for a cure.</p>

<p>Another reciter says: “When my sister and myself
were lumps of lasses we were down the road<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>
one day with a cow of my father’s. When we brought
her home the milk was running from her, and she lay
down on the floor and she wouldn’t rise. When
they tried to put her up she would make as if she
would climb up the wall.”</p>

<p>In fact, as another reciter in Rothiemurchus
said: “It used to be a very common experience
to have cows going off their milk, and sometimes
dying from the effects of a person possessed of an
Evil Eye looking upon them, and it is still believed
that cases of this kind happen.”</p>

<p>A cow that was “kicking and would let nobody
milk her,” being cured by one of the processes against
the Evil Eye, the cure was understood to certify the
diagnosis.</p>

<p>Mrs. McN. was milking her cow. A woman passing
at the time remarked, looking at the cow the
while, “That is a grand cow, and she gives a great
deal of milk.” “Yes, she is a good cow,” replied the
owner, and the woman having passed on there was
no more about it, until a little while after the milking
was done the cow lay down on the ground and
began to roll in great pain. There never was any
doubt but that it was a case of injury by the Evil
Eye. The cow was cured by magic.</p>

<p>Another cow “grew to be unwell, and she was
rolling herself upon the ground.” She was so unwell
that the schoolmaster, who was a great friend of her
owner’s, advised him to send for a man to flay her.
She recovered.</p>

<p>Of course a recognised wizard may have the Evil
Eye as much as a more innocent person. The
reciter of this, a credulous man, no doubt, and uneducated,
with the gift of the gab and a good deal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>
of natural shrewdness, a distillery workman, is detailing
his own experience. “The cows were all
tied in the byre, and we were looking in the window
and saw the <i lang="gd">Buidseach ruadh</i> (the red wizard) standing
at the byre door. The door was in two halves, the
upper half was open at the time, the lower closed,
and he was leaning on it and gazing with all his
might at one of the cows. The kitchen was at the
end of the byre, and they always came straight down
from the kitchen when they were going to milk.
The women just came down then, and when they
came to the cow that he had been looking at, not
a drop of milk could they get. When they untied
her to let her out she gave a loud bellow, and running
up by the kitchen door made for the fire and tried
to go up by the chain through the roof of the house.
They had nothing for it but tie her up again, and
for some days they did not get a drop of milk from
her, and her skin became so loose on her it looked
as if hardly sticking to her flesh at all. When the
day for churning came they found the butter was
gone also.”</p>

<p>A Kintyre man recites the following of an authority
consulted for the cure of the Evil Eye. “Her cow,
put out for the first time after calving, became wild
and jumped against everything like to kill herself.
There was nothing for it but just to put her back
into the house. Everybody was sure the beast had
been <i lang="gd">air a cronachadh</i> by some person’s Evil Eye, or
bewitched by witchcraft. When the woman to whom
the cow belonged came to know of it she came up,
and going up to the cow, gave her a clap or two
on the back, said something, and in a minute or two
the cow was as quiet as she had ever been.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span></p>

<p>A farmer of the name of M. had the farm of B.,
near Campbeltown. He had a favourite cow which
he would not part with for anything. Some drovers
wished to buy this cow, but M. refused, and though
the drovers persisted, he would not part with her.
They went to the cow and began to soothe and fondle
her. When they left the cow began to go about in a
circle, and could not be got out of that circle. At
length the farmer was forced to kill her. This was
told by an educated and reliable gentleman, without
prejudice, so to say, to his belief or disbelief in the
origin of the illness.</p>

<p>One is apt to smile at any one talking of an animal
going up the chimney by the pot chain; frightened
animals do curious things. The writer of this, having
opened the window in the parlour widely, the door
being shut to prevent it going into the house, was
trying to drive out a strange cat. There was a lighted
fire in the chimney, but the cat, without trying the
window, went up the chimney. The fire being damped
down and a dustpan put on the top of it, the cat
returned to civilisation, and then disappeared through
the window.</p>

<p>One other symptom comes from the Black Isle,
Ross-shire. H. says that belief in the Evil Eye was
very common in his native place, and has a good
hold still on people’s minds. It was said to do
injury to beasts, in many ways, among others that
they could be blinded by it. His father had a striking
case while living in the Parish of Redcastle. One
of his cows died of what was considered a natural
trouble, no Evil Eye influence being thought of.
He had a quey grazing on the farm of a friend on
the opposite side of the Beauly Firth, so he went for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>
her and brought her home by Kessock Ferry, where
some people examined her and admired her. She
was a dun, and a fine-looking animal. Having
reached home the quey was tied in the byre, apparently
in good health. They however soon noticed
that she had a habit of standing back in her stall to
the full extent of the tether rope, and do what they
would they could not get her to stand forward. A
woman with knowledge of Evil Eye cases was consulted.
After examining the beast in the byre by
herself she told them the quey was blind, because
some one’s eye had fallen on her. She recommended
the following procedure to cure the animal and find
out who had done the injury. She was to be let out
and, no one going before her or trying to turn her,
allowed to go where she liked. If this were done
she said the quey would, of her own accord, go to
the house of the person who had made her blind,
and that she would go three times round the house
bellowing, and then come back to her own byre
quite well with recovered sight. This procedure
was carried out. She went straight for a neighbour’s
house, went round it three times, bellowed, and
came back quite well and seeing. The reciter added,
“Now the woman that could do that and find out
things of that kind must have had some power herself,
quite as much as the one whose eye had fallen
upon the heifer.” The reciter of the above is an
uneducated man, and superstitious in other ways.</p>

<p>A believer, a native of Knapdale, tells the following.
For a considerable time none of her cows had
quey calves, but at length she got one, a nice beast,
of which she was particularly careful. When it was
first let out she went herself to watch it. At that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>
time she had a neighbour who had an ill-will to her,
although they were on speaking terms, though without
having much to do with each other. While she
was watching the calf this neighbour came out of
her own house, and putting her hands on each of her
sides, stood and gazed for a few seconds at the calf.
While she was staring at it the calf gave a ‘loup,’
rushed as if it were mad through the place, and when,
with a deal of difficulty it had been caught and put
into the byre, it kept leaping straight up, and seemed
as if it could not rest. The person consulted said
he could do nothing in the case, and that it was ill
from the other woman looking at it. Subsequently
she had two more quey calves of which she was very
proud and pleased to have them, and as they were
grazing in a park near the road, many people admired
them. One day the same objectionable neighbour
went, and placing her two arms on the dyke, stared
at the calves for some time. “I saw her with my own
eyes and did not like it, but said nothing.” Not long
after her daughter came in and said that the white
calf was lying dead among the nettles. “On hearing
this I trembled, but spoke quite calmly and said, ‘Is
it?’” On examination, sure enough the calf was
dead, and the other was ill also. She consulted a
skilled woman, and the remaining calf got better.
This reciter added that since then she had lost beasts
through the same person’s Evil Eye, and is in terror
when she sees her coming about the house.</p>

<p>A woman who lived on Loch Awe-side, who was
believed to have the Evil Eye, and whose father was
also credited with it, was exchanging brood hens
with a neighbour. She brought her own hen, and
was going to take away the one to be exchanged. In<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>
the absence of the mistress, the girl who was keeping
the house was going to give the cow a drink, and the
woman accompanied her. There was nothing wrong
with the cow then, but later in the day the cow’s calf
died, and the cow herself began to take some kind
of fits, and though she lived for a while never got well.
When night came the hens were crowing, and next
morning two of them were found dead. The hen
that had been brought was put on the eggs, but if
she was, it was not long that she remained on them.
She took to the hills and was never caught, and all
this was the consequence of the Evil Eye.</p>

<p>Even more common than injury to cows and
calves is the deterioration of milk. Mrs. McL., appealing
to her husband for confirmation, told how that
in the winter-time she began to churn sometime after
dark. Her husband helped her with it, and they had
just finished, and she was going to stop and take off
the butter, when a young man came in. When he
went away she went back to her churn, but not a
bit of butter could she get. To gather it she took
another turn of churning, but the milk only swelled
and went over the churn mouth. The butter was
all gone. It was this young man’s Evil Eye.</p>

<p>Another nearly similar case to the above, and
they could be considerably added to, happened to
the mother of the reciter, who was churning, and a
woman, supposed to possess an Evil Eye, and also
suspected of a measure of witchcraft, coming in, “the
butter got scattered into a kind of grainy substance,
and do what she would the churner could not get it
to gather again.”</p>

<p>Horses, of course, are liable to the malign influence
of the Evil Eye. —— had a nice white horse<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>
which he used to lend on hire to the minister. It was
much admired, and one day when it came home a
neighbour, who bore the owner no goodwill, came
forward and, standing beside the horse, said in Gaelic,
“You have got fine limbs;” he then walked away.
Shortly afterwards the horse threw itself down on
the ground and kicked as if in great pain. It was
at first supposed to be an attack of colic, and the
son walked it out a little, but so soon as it entered
the stable it fell down and was like to die. A woman
with skill being consulted, cured the horse and confirmed
their suspicion of it being a case of Evil Eye.</p>

<p>Ministers’ horses do not escape any more than
those of laymen. A Mull woman related the following:—The
minister, whose grave you may see there,
had a fine horse. His man had it out ploughing,
and without previous illness or warning of any kind,
it fell down and could not plough another furrow.
The minister came to see it.</p>

<p>“<i lang="gd">A mhinistear, tha an t-each air a chronachadh.
Feumaidh mi dhol airson eolas a chronachaidh.</i>”</p>

<p>“<i lang="gd">Eisd, eisd, cha dean thu sin. Tha fios agad nach
eil mise a’ creidsinn ann a leithid sin.</i>”</p>

<p>“<i lang="gd">Direach falbhaidh sibhse a steach, agus managie mi
fein an t-each.</i>”</p>

<p>(“Minister, the horse is <i lang="gd">air a cronachadh</i>, and I must
go for <i lang="gd">eolas a chronachaidh</i>.” “Hush, hush, you will
not do that; you know that I do not believe the like
of that.” “Just you go in, and I’ll manage the horse
myself.”)</p>

<p>We may finish the incident which tells how the
minister did as was suggested, and how, as soon as
he was out of sight, off the lad set for what he considered
skilled assistance. Having got it, in less than<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>
three hours the horse was quite well and ploughing.
When the minister was again looking on, the lad remarked
on the rapid recovery from the process used,
but the minister was unconvinced.</p>

<p>“<i lang="gd">Cha’n eil mi dol a thoirt creideas da leithid sin
idir.</i>”</p>

<p><i lang="gd">Thuirt an gille: “Well, tha mi fein ‘s an t-each a’
creidsinn ann.”</i></p>

<p>(“I am not going to give credence to the like of
that at all.” The lad replied: “Well, both I and the
horse believe in it.”)</p>

<p>A like case. “You remember A. B. He had a
braw mare; everybody was praising her, and there
wasn’t the likes of her to be seen about the place.
A man who was passing waited to look at her, and
praised her for being a splendid beast. But if he
did, when she reached home she fell down and would
neither rise nor eat.”</p>

<p>Mrs. G. said: “One of our horses, a fine beast,
was going past the barn when all at once it fell on
the ground. They got it into the stable. In a little
time it could not move its body, but was tossing its
head from side to side and seemed to be in great
pain. It was striking its head on the ground so much
that we thought it would kill itself.”</p>

<p>A case in which the illness had lasted for some
time before skilled advice was got, is the following:
“D. D.’s father-in-law had a horse unwell and not
expected to recover. It was lying in the stable quite
stiff, and had neither eaten nor drunk anything for
some days.”</p>

<p>A farmer who had two fine horses told the reciter
to put the saddle on one of them and meet him on
his way home from a visit he had to pay. D. McT.,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>
as instructed, saddled the better of the two horses
and started to meet his father. He was very careful,
leading the horse instead of riding it. He met his
father within three miles of home driving in a cart
with a neighbour. When they met, his father said,
“You have killed that beast. Why did you ride it so
hard?” D. told his father, what was the fact, that
he had not ridden at all, but walked all the way from
home. “Look at the horse,” said his father, and
the horse was pouring of sweat and trembling. He
turned home, but could not keep up with the cart,
and only managed to make it crawl back with difficulty.
As soon as it was got into the stall, it lay
down and commenced kicking as if in great pain.
The horse was cured.</p>

<p>A man of whom we have already spoken as injuring
animals with his Evil Eye unintentionally, as
a reciter tells us, “was at this time threshing with
my father. They had no threshing-mill, and did it
all with flails. One day my father had been out
ploughing, and had the best mare ever they had in
the plough. Coming home, he had to pass the barn
to go to the stable, and McA., of the Evil Eye, came
to the door and looked after the mare. That was
enough; before the mare reached the stable door
she began to shake and tremble, and it was with
great difficulty they managed to get her into the
stall. They knew quite well what was the matter.”</p>

<p>One other horse case. The reciter says: “One
Sunday I was standing there on the little hill at C.,
and I saw a man coming towards me from Gartachara.
I knew the man and waited till he passed. He
went down to C. I never thought of anything being
wrong, but when I turned down the way the man<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>
had come up, what did I find but a beautiful brown
horse I had at the time, lying on his belly in the
water where the horses used to take their drink.
He could not stand on his feet, but I got help, and
we managed to get him into the kailyard, where he
lay groaning.” The horse recovered.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Fowls are said to be affected. A certain woman
had been suspected of hindering the butter from
coming at a churning. The case was being reported
to a collector, when a bystander expressed doubts as
to the existence of an Evil Eye. The reciter then
said that her own experience had proved the truth
of the accusation in the case of this individual. “She
was living for a year beside me, and all that year,
although I had most beautiful hens, they laid nothing
but soft eggs. They would be found in the mornings
all scattered here and there on the floor. Indeed I
thought they dropped more eggs than was natural.
It was only when talking about the hens to another
neighbour that it was suggested to me that her Evil
Eye was the cause. Then I knew that there would
be no use keeping hens while that woman was beside
me, so I sold them all. I got clear of her at the end
of the year. I never said anything to her about it,
for I was afraid.”</p>

<p>The reciter of the following said that he was positively
certain that the facts were as stated, though it had
not occurred to himself. “A certain man once called
at a house, and a beautiful brood of chickens were
going about on the kitchen floor. He was not right
out when a stool fell on them and smothered every
one of them. From the kitchen he went to the byre,
and saw there a beautiful quey, which he professed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>
to admire very much. He was not long gone when
the quey became unwell.” The belief was firmly
established that the chickens and the quey had been
<i lang="gd">air an cronachadh</i>.</p>

<p>A firm believer gives the following:—“One time
her mother had a brood of ducks, and every time
Mrs. Mac. came in she praised the ducks, but meanwhile
one after another was dying, until at last only
one remained. One day this one was in the kitchen
when Mrs. Mac. came in, and she praised it as usual,
but when she was going away she tramped on it
and killed it. They were quite sure it was her Evil
Eye that had been doing the mischief.”</p>

<p>Not only live fowls but even eggs may be injured.
B. S., a respectable girl, a domestic servant, able to read
and write, and quite reliable, gives this as a sample.
She had bought some eggs, and on bringing them
home a neighbour woman was in the house and
looked at the eggs. She went away, and afterwards
some of the eggs were put on to boil. Although left
on the fire for the usual time, it was found they were
not boiled enough, and were returned to be further
boiled. One of them then cracked and sent the hot
water in sparks in her face, and the others were so
broken that they were of no use. The people in the
house attributed the mishap to the woman who had
been there when the eggs were brought in.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>On considering the whole of these symptoms, the
principal thing that strikes one to be urged in excuse
of the faith that is in the reciters is that what was
wrong came on apparently suddenly, in some cases
after a visit from a person already suspected, but as
often as not it was the suddenness of the mishap<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>
which gave ground to the accusation of some probably
entirely innocent passer-by. Unless faith in
the Evil Eye were already present, there seems
hardly ground for any person with experience of
cattle and their ailments to evolve a theory of the
existence of any such latent power in the individuals
accused. So little critical people became, that everything
unexpected was referred to the Evil Eye. As
a Kintyre man said, “If anything went wrong with
the beef when the winter supply was cured, it was
attributed to the Evil Eye of some one or other.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="BENEFIT_TO_THE_OWNER_OF_AN">BENEFIT TO THE OWNER OF AN
EVIL EYE</h2>
</div>


<p>Though in many cases involuntary, it has been
pointed out that some believe that individuals knowing
or professing to know that they have an Evil
Eye, from sheer devilry, exercise it to the injury of
others, though for no visible benefit to themselves.</p>

<p>A reliable and fairly educated woman, whose father
began life as a crofter and died what in that class of
life is to be considered as a rich man, a native of
South Uist, relates:—There was a woman near her
father’s house believed to have a very bad eye, and
to be able to do mischief with it. Her aunt was
very careful as much as possible to keep out of this
woman’s sight, and if she happened to come about
at churning time her aunt would put the churn so
that the woman would not see it. She would not
sell a pound of butter to her for any consideration.
The curious thing was that although that woman
could take away the produce from other people’s
cows, she seemed unable to make any profit of it
for herself. It was just her envious and malicious
nature that made her take it (the produce) from
other people, although it was not going to benefit
herself. She was well known by all the people in
the district, and they all suspected her of the practice
of witchcraft. It was on account of this suspicion,
selling butter to her was objected to.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span></p>

<p>It is not necessary that the desire to possess
something should be, as it were, illegitimate or unreasonable
to cause damage. Thus M. MacL. was
relating how a neighbour’s horse had died. “People
say that it was blighted by the Evil Eye. One of
his sons had his eye <i>in</i> it, for he expected to get it
for himself, but it took ill. At first they thought it
was going to get better, for it was eating its food in
the evening, but on the following morning this son
went out to the stable when he rose, and found it
lying down. When it saw him it got up, gave itself
a shake, and fell down dead.”</p>

<p>There may be, however, indirect advantages from
being credited by your neighbours with having an
Evil Eye. Mrs. MacE., a cottar, lived on the farm
of L. in one of the inner isles. She was believed to
have had the Evil Eye very strongly, and people
would do almost anything rather than offend her,
so general was the impression that she could injure
any person if she wished to do so. The reciter served
for some time on a farm that marched with hers, and
he says that when Mrs. MacE. came their way she
could have almost whatever favour she chose to ask,
so much were they afraid of her Evil Eye. He often
heard his master remark that he would not incur
her displeasure for almost any consideration, in case
she might do him injury.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="DISADVANTAGE_TO_THE_OWNER_OF">DISADVANTAGE TO THE OWNER OF
AN EVIL EYE</h2>
</div>


<p>If in an indirect way, as above pointed out, some
benefits may accrue to one credited with the Evil Eye,
it is also said that they may personally suffer serious
loss. An old Islay woman who can read Gaelic well,
intelligent and full of information, says she knows for
certain there are people who possess the Evil Eye.
She believes that it is not a matter of choice with
them, they cannot help it. Some even do harm
to their own cattle. R., who was at one time in
Islay, could not go into his own byre but one or
other of the cattle would be ill after it. This was
so well known that a big dairymaid that he had
engaged, a north-country woman, protested against
his coming over the byre doorstep. It was because
he had such an envious eye that he did so much
mischief.</p>

<p>Another reciter tells us of the same farmer that
they kept him in the house when his own cattle were
being taken in from pasture, in case by admiring
them he might be the means of doing them an
injury.</p>

<p>Another man in the same island, having got a first-prize
animal, said to the herd that he would go out to
see it. The herd, fearing evil, tried to dissuade him,
but he persisted in going. Shortly afterwards the
animal died. His neighbours used to hurry their cattle<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>
out of his sight when they saw him coming that way.
It was said he could not help it.</p>

<p>D. C. had the Evil Eye very powerfully. On one
occasion he went to examine some cattle he had newly
bought, and when he looked at them some of them fell
down as if they would die. The herd ran across the
hill to a hamlet marching with D. C.’s farm and got a
bottle of water from a skilled person. When sprinkled
on the cattle they at once recovered.</p>

<p>A man in Bowmore went into his own byre one
night when his cousin, who lived with him, was
milking his cow. He had a nice calf in the byre,
and he put his arms round its neck and began
to praise it very much. His cousin said to him
it was not good to do that. The next morning the
calf was found dead, an occurrence credited to his
Evil Eye.</p>

<p>A native of Mull avowed her firm belief in the Evil
Eye, especially quoting what her mother had told her
of a large farmer where she had been brought up who
owned a number of cattle, and who had the Evil Eye.
“Every time that man went into his own byre the
best of his cattle were sure to be unwell afterwards,
and they were often dying with him. He could not
help it. At last he got a dairymaid who, when she
had become acquainted with his peculiarities, would
not allow him to go into the byre at all, or near the
cows. She turned him back when she would see him
coming.”</p>

<p>Exactly the same account of another farmer is
given by a reciter in Ross-shire in the parish of U——.
She knew him very well by sight, having often seen
him at markets, and many times she had heard that he
had the Evil Eye, could not help it, and often hurt his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>
own cattle “by thinking too highly of them.” This
information was corroborated by another, D. McL.,
who also knew the man by name and sight, having
served on a farm in the same district, and he often
heard of him hurting his own cattle.</p>

<p>Of course the Evil Eye is as lively in Ireland as on
this side of St. George’s Channel; but the following
experience of a native of county Cork, an educated,
reliable woman, the wife of a member of the lower
ranks of the Civil Service, while staying in Jura, is
interesting. Desiring a drink of water one day she
called at a house, the mistress of which met her at the
door and invited her to come in to have a drink of
milk. When she went in she found a girl churning.
After sitting for a minute or two Mrs. M. would have
left, but was urged to wait for a little to taste the new
butter off the churn on a scone. She sat a while, and
the girl continued at the churn, evidently working as
hard as she could, perspiring, and yet there were no
signs of butter. Mrs. M. innocently remarked, “Dear
me, I never thought churning was so difficult.” The
woman and girl looked at each other, but without speaking.
The girl continued churning, until at last her
mistress said, “You may put the churn past, you will
get no butter off it to-day.” Shortly after Mrs. M.
left without having tasted the butter, but beyond that
thinking nothing of the circumstances. About two
months afterwards, while walking in the same direction,
she called at the same house. When going in she
noticed the girl again at the churn, but making a
rush with it to the other end of the house. Mrs. M.
observed, “Oh! Mrs. Mac., I hope I am not interfering
with your work. I see J. going out of the
way.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span></p>

<p>“She is churning, and is going away with the
churn, for the last time you were here she did not
get one bit of butter off the churn.”</p>

<p>“I am sorry to hear that; I am sure I did nothing
to keep the butter from coming.”</p>

<p>“I do not know; she got none at any rate, that’s
all I can say.”</p>

<p>Of two women living beside each other in Islay,
one was credited with the Evil Eye, and supposed
to take away the dairy produce from her neighbours.
One year her neighbour for a whole summer was
unable to get a bit of butter from her churning.
Her suspicion rested strongly on the other. Her
account of it was as follows: “I tried everything.
They told me to put a horseshoe in the churn, and
I did that. Others told me to put salt in it, and I
did that, but neither did any good. I scrubbed and
scrubbed the churn and the milk dishes, but it was
of no use. The milk would only come up with a
hissing sound. I was even afraid to use the sour
milk in baking scones, for I was sure there was
something not right about it. The pig got fat that
year, for it was getting the most of the milk. At
last I consulted a neighbour, and she told me just
what I knew already, that it was a bad woman beside
me that was taking away the butter. She advised
me not to bother any more, and to keep churning,
for the woman would stop her mischief by-and-by,
and then the butter would come back as it had
gone. I did as she told me, and through time the
butter came. I was not speaking about it to any
one, for I did not want people to know I believed
that she could do so much harm.”</p>

<p>A well-educated small farmer’s wife, a woman of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>
five-and-thirty, knew a husband and wife who both
possessed the Evil Eye. They were quite aware
themselves that they did, and could not help it.
Passing through a park where several colts were
grazing, one of which took their fancy, they expressed
their admiration of it. That evening the colt
took ill and never recovered.</p>

<p>One would think that a little consideration would
have made it clear that with two in the same house
equally unfortunate nothing they had could have
succeeded with them, and yet there was no account
of this couple being in worse circumstances than
their neighbours.</p>

<p>It certainly is a curious development, the belief
already alluded to of the injurious action of the
Evil Eye of the farmer on his own stock. “W. C.
was on intimate terms with a neighbouring farmer,
whom he visited frequently. It was observed that
if at any time he (the farmer) praised an animal,
something for certain happened to it afterwards. On
one occasion he talked admiringly of the poultry,
and shortly after all of them died.”</p>

<p>Another reciter said: “In our own time a farmer
required to be kept from going among his own
cattle, lest by looking on them they should be
injured.” These cases respectively were in Islay and
Harris.</p>

<p>Judging from personal experience of an old friend
addicted to prophesying on his first appearance in
the morning the sort of weather for the day, the
result being, as we of a younger generation all
believed, almost invariably wrong, it seems probable
that these stories have arisen in connection with
men who talked freely, giving opinions based upon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>
hurried observation. Where silence would have left
no ground for animadversion the wordy man had
his sayings remembered against him, especially when
he was wrong, and the good beasts subsequently
turned out failures, as the fine days foretold were
generally wet.</p>

<p>The mere expression of admiration should be avoided
by those who wish to escape the accusation of the
Evil Eye. A youngish woman says, “You have
seen my cousin J.’s third boy. He was the finest
and nicest looking of all the children. When six
months old he was a very pretty child. One day
a woman came into the house; the baby was on
his mother’s arm, and the visitor began to praise
the child, and praised it very much. She was hardly
away when a man came, and he began to praise the
child as the woman had done. After he went away
like a shot the baby took ill. They did not know
what was the matter with him, or what to do, for
he was growing worse. He continued in that way
for some days. At last granny said she was sure he
had been <i lang="gd">air a chronachadh</i>, and advised the mother
to consult a woman who was supposed to have
knowledge to cure such cases. J. was not willing
to go at first, but granny insisted that it would do
no harm at any rate to go and speak to the woman.
She went, but did not tell anybody at the time, for
of course they would be speaking about it. As soon
as she told the woman why she had come, the woman
told her that the child had been injured by the
Evil Eye, and she described exactly the man and
woman who had done the harm, although my cousin
had not mentioned man or woman to her. Was it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span>
not wonderful how she knew the very ones that
had done it?” She cured the child. The above
happened in one of the islands.</p>

<p>The following is from Ross-shire (Tarbat): “One
of my sisters was blighted by a woman who lived
beside them. She was well known for her uncanny
ways. The way the thing happened was this: The
little girl was tied on an elder sister’s back, and they
were sent out for a walk. They had not gone far
when the woman in question came forward, and
putting the shawl back from the child’s face said,
‘What a pretty little girl! which of them is this?’
When the children returned their mother found that
the young one was very ill, and on questioning the
elder girl, she said that they had met this woman and
repeated what she had said. Mother at once suspected
what was the matter, sent for the woman, and charged
her with having hurt her child. She protested that
she had not done the child any injury, but the elder
girl spoke up and said, ‘Yes, you looked at her and
said she was pretty, and did not bless her.’ The
woman admitted this, and that if she had done
any harm to the child she was sorry for it, but it
could be sorted if wrong had been done. She
operated a charm, and the child was soon as brisk
as ever.”</p>

<p>A domestic servant relates that a woman who
lived in Kil C. had a first-rate cow that was giving a
large quantity of milk. One evening when she was
milking another woman came into the byre and
began praising the cow, and expressing her amazement
at the quantity of milk she gave. No more
was thought of this, till at next milking the cow did
not give so much, and continued to get worse. It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>
became evident that she had been injured by the
person who had praised her so much.</p>

<p>A Campbeltown man says, “I am sure I do not
know about these things, for I have never seen anything
of it myself, but I mind my neighbour over
there, D. M., saying to me one day not long ago, that
a woman was going past some time before that, and
she began to praise one of his cows, saying what a
grand udder she had and such fine teats. No doubt
the cow was good, he said, and a fine milker, but after
that day her milk went from her.”</p>

<p>A married woman of about forty-five “believes
firmly in the existence of the Evil Eye,” and relates
as a proof: Mrs. McD., a neighbour, told her lately
that she was churning. The butter was actually on
the churn when Mrs. B. came in, and looking into
the churn began to praise the stuff, and said how
well off she was to be getting such beautiful butter.
She just stayed a minute or two and then went away.
After she was gone the butter scattered on the churn,
and do what she would she could not get it to gather
again. All she could get was froth, and it continued
that way with her for several churnings.</p>

<p>A girl of twenty-four, a domestic servant, a
crofter’s daughter with a good School Board education,
said, “<i lang="gd">Cronachadh</i> is still in it. My mother was
churning not long ago at all, and that woman
Mrs. C. came in, and looking into the churn said,
‘Oh! what a lot of butter!’ Well, the butter went
off, and though my mother churned and churned she
did not get a bit of that churning, nor for a churning
or two after that. We believed that the butter had
been taken away.”</p>

<p>A woman who admits that she is a firm believer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>
in the Evil Eye, tells of the following case within
her own knowledge. Two women were living beside
each other, and she knew them both personally.
Each had a pig, and they were striving whose pig
should be fattest. One of them had a cow, the
other had not. The one that had the cow was giving
her pig lots of milk. It was growing fast and surpassing
the other. One day the neighbour came in,
and while they were looking at it and saying how
well it was thriving, she remarked, “<i lang="gd">Cha’n iongantach
a mhuc agadsa bhi cho math on is e sin an seorsa biadh
tha thu toirt dith.</i>” (“No wonder your pig is so good,
since that is the kind of food you are giving to her.”)
After a little while the woman left, but was not long
gone when the pig took ill, and when it was apparently
getting no better they sent to Gortan-na-lag for one
living there believed to have knowledge. When he
came and saw the pig he said they had been too late
in sending for him, and told them at once that it had
been <i lang="gd">air a cronachadh</i>, and he showed them who had
done the mischief.</p>

<p>A <i lang="gd">cailleach</i>, notorious as having the Evil Eye, was
calling in the house of an acquaintance of the reciter,
and when she was leaving she praised a fine hen that
was in the yard. It was one of her best hens, and
the woman praised it very much. That very day
what happened but this hen was taken in dead, and
the woman declared she could never get out of her
mind that it had been a case of Evil Eye blight.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="A_LOOK_DOES_IT">A LOOK DOES IT</h2>
</div>


<p>The belief in an Evil Eye having arisen, it is perfectly
clear that a mere look, quite unaccompanied by any
other action, would soon be considered a quite sufficient
cause of the mischief such an eye would
occasion. A gamekeeper’s wife, a “canty body,” as
she is described, told how some lads on a Sunday,
who had watched a mare and foal grazing for some
time, were credited with damaging the foal, because
shortly after they left it lay kicking on the ground
and would not suck.</p>

<p>A horse going up the main street of Bowmore in
Islay was looked at by a man passing. A few minutes
after it fell and could not rise, till a woman, C. McI.,
came and did “something to it.” The horse got all
right, and the woman consulted maintained that it
was a case of Evil Eye.</p>

<p>A man now resident in Glasgow was visiting
some friends on a farm in one of the inner islands,
and a man riding past was observed looking rather
attentively at the cows in a field beside the road.
He was supposed to have paid particular attention
to a cow which, shortly after he had passed, was
noticed to be unwell. It was treated as a case of
the Evil Eye, and recovered.</p>

<p>These cases occurred with persons not notorious.
The following is one in which the woman who affected
the cattle was generally believed to have the Evil Eye.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>
The reciter’s father was driving four cows from the
park one evening, and when passing this woman’s
house she stood at the door looking at the cows.
In a moment off they went as hard as they could
run. One of them, a handsome beast that had been
bought from a farmer in Gartbreac, when they got
them into the byre, was tied to a heavy kitchen
grate which was there, but she ran out of the byre
with the grate hanging to her neck, and climbed up
a peat stack nearly reaching the top of it. From
that day they never got any further good of that
cow, and were decidedly of opinion that she had
been bewitched by the woman.</p>

<p>Not the cattle alone but milk also is influenced by
a mere look. We give an instance in the words of
the narrator:—</p>

<p>“<i lang="gd">Bha ’n toradh air a thoirt uam fein an uiridh.
Mhaistir sinn gus an robh Raonull agus Donull agus
mi fein a ruith leis an fhallus ach ged a leanamaid air
fathast cha ’n fhaigheamaid mir ime. ’S an anns an
t-sabhal bhios sinn a cruinneachadh a bhainne agus
thainig duine ’n rathad latha aig nach eil bo da chuid
fein agus dh’amhairc e air a bhainne ’san t-sabhal:
bha sinn a’ deanadh dhe gum b’esan a rinn an cron.
Bha na cairdean gam’ chomhairleachadh gun a bhi
leigeil le daoine bhi faicinn a’bhainne ach mi bhi cuimhnicheadh
nach eil na h-uile duine cosmhuil rium fein.
Well, o’n am sin, tha sinn a toirt fanear nach fhaigh
neach sam bith cothrom air dol far am bheil am bainne
agus tha sinn a faotainn a nis urrad ime’s bu chor air
na h-uile maistreadh.</i>” (“The butter was taken from
myself last year. We churned until Ronald and
Donald and myself were running with sweat, but
although we had continued at it till now we could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span>
not get a bit of butter. It is in the barn that we
gather the milk, and a man who has not got a cow
of his own came the way one day and he looked
on the milk in the barn, and we were making out
that it was he who had done the harm. The friends
were advising me not to be allowing people to see
the milk, but that I should remember that every
person is not like myself. Well, from that time we
are taking care that nobody will get an opportunity
to go where the milk is, and now we are
getting as much butter as we ought to get on every
churning.”)</p>

<p>The Isle of Man, from a Gaelic point of view, may
be considered as likely to be much the same as the
islands of Argyll, and a lighthouse-keeper, stationed
there for some time, tells us he heard a good deal
about the Evil Eye, and that belief in it is pretty
common. “If a person is seen to look closely at
a cow when passing her he is at once suspected,
and is likely to be requested by the owner of the
beast to take certain steps to prevent injurious
consequences.”</p>

<p>As we have seen above, the very natural consequence
of this belief in a look doing injury leads
to the hiding of things liable to harm.</p>

<p>A somewhat amusing story of the effects of a
look is from Arran.</p>

<p>“One time M. K. and myself were at a meeting, and
there was an old bachelor there who kept looking
at us all the time. We noticed it, but did not think
much about it until after we went home, but when
we got home both of us began to yawn and rift, and
could not stop it. We were quite sure that we had
been hurt by the ‘eye’ of the old fellow. M. K.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>
made a drink of salt and water for us, and we took
it and that cured us.”</p>

<p>Eructation in Arran seems to have a special connection
with the Evil Eye and witchcraft. Another
reciter remembers quite well a reputed witch going
into her mother’s house, and not very long after she
left her younger sister, a child at the time, became
unwell. Her mother at once suspected that the fault
lay with the woman who had left, so she sent after
her and brought her back. The reputed witch
“mixed salt and water, drank it herself, rifted fearfully,
and in a little while the child got quite well.”</p>

<p>The use of salt as a “preservative” is illustrated
in the case of an Arran woman who was a strong
believer in and much afraid of the effects of the
Evil Eye. She had one cow, and it gave her much
discomfort when she saw the cow grazing near the
roadside, fearing that some passer-by might “put his
eye in her.” To keep the milk right, if she gave any
to be carried away, or even “to be drunk on the
premises,” she invariably put salt in it, and that sometimes
to excess. The reciter said, “For a while we
were getting milk from her for a man staying with
us who was seriously annoyed when the milk was
more than ordinarily salt, giving vent to his discontent
saying, ‘Why the deuce does she not let us
put saut in oor ain milk?’”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="AVOIDING_THE_LOOK">AVOIDING THE LOOK</h2>
</div>


<p>The following recited by a Mull woman is interesting
as showing that smiths and Druids, or their modern
representatives, have still some affinity. The reciter
told how her mother’s cow had taken suddenly ill
as her brother Sandy was starting for the smithy.
When he arrived there he mentioned the circumstance
to the smith. “‘And did your mother no send
any message to me?’ said the smith. Sandy said,
‘No, she had sent no message.’ ‘Well, I think your
mother might ken that anything that I could do,
I would do for her, and she might have sent for me.’
My brother suggested that he had better come away
down to see her, so the smith came down and found
my mother very vexed about the cow. He said, ‘The
cow is bad enough, but it might have been one of the
family, for the one that could do this could do the
other thing just as well, but we’ll see what can be
done.’ Having taken certain steps, he advised her
also not to allow any one to see the cow on any
account, for three would soon pass, he said, and if
she would allow them in to see the cow, the cow
would be gone. The three were strong, and she
would need to use all her strength to keep them
out. He told her that was all he could do just then,
but that she must send Sandy over twice to him for
a bottle. When he went away she told the children
not to tell any one where she was, and she went to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>
the byre to watch the cow. Having got tubs she
filled them with stones and placed them against the
byre door with spades and everything she could think
of to keep the door from being opened. She was not
long there when a man passed with a horse and a
dog. He came to the kitchen door and asked the
children where their mother was, but they did not
tell him. He then came to the byre door, lifted the
sneck, and when it did not yield tried to force it
open with all his might, saying, ‘<i lang="gd">A Cheit nic Iain, am
bheil thu ann sud?</i>’ (‘Kate, John’s daughter, are you
there?’) My mother knew his voice as that of a near
neighbour, and answered: ‘<i lang="gd">Tha Iain, tha a’ mhart
gu bochd agus tha i na laidh cul an doruis ’s cha ’n
urrainn dhuit tighinn a steach.</i>’ (‘Yes, John, the cow
is unwell, and she is lying behind the door and you
cannot get in.’) My mother had to tell the lie, or he
would force the door open. The man went away,
and these were the three that the smith had said
would come the way—the man and the horse and
the dog. And it was that man that had done the
harm to the cow, but it was found out in time and
the cow got better, but it was that very year my
two brothers died, and nobody knows whether he
had anything to do with their death or no.”</p>

<p>We include this under Evil Eye, because there
is no statement of any accusation of witchcraft
against the “man,” or for the matter of that “of the
horse or the dog.”</p>

<p>In another case, in which a certain George T., by
his devices, cured a cow of which he had said it was
“bitten, wounded” (<i lang="gd">teum</i>), he asked if there had
been a man with a black head praising the cow.
When he was told that they had no knowledge of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>
such a thing, “Well,” said he, “it is a man with a
black head that has injured your cow with the Evil
Eye, but be under no anxiety, the cow is all right
now.” He asked my mother if she had shown to
any person the whole of the butter that came off
the churn. My mother said that she was not showing
(was not in the custom of showing) the butter to
any one. “That is right, Flora. For all you have
ever seen, although you would not keep but as much
as the size of an egg, be sure that you do not let the
whole of the butter be seen by anybody.”</p>

<p>An Islay farmer’s daughter remembers a certain
woman who was supposed to possess an Evil Eye,
and who paid them occasional visits. So terrified
were they lest she should interfere with their butter,
that whenever they saw her coming while they were
churning, they would throw a cloth over the churn
and put it out of sight until the woman left.</p>

<p>From Stratherrick, Ross-shire, a reciter said,
“When she heard so much talk about cattle being
injured by the Evil Eye, and the substance taken
away, she became afraid of this, and especially when
churning disliked anybody to come where the churn
was, so much so that she used to do the churning
in an out-of-the-way corner of the house.”</p>

<p>It is evidently not so easy to protect a horse or
a cow from a glance of an Evil Eye, but a lady tells
how that, visiting at a farmhouse, she saw the old
cook, who had been long in the farmer’s service,
running in great excitement to gather in a brood of
young ducklings that were running about the yard.
Being a frequent visitor and intimately acquainted
with the cook, she asked her what was wrong, and
why she was hurrying the ducklings at that hour of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>
the day. “Oh,” said the cook, “Mr. A. is coming
up the road, and last time he was here I had a
beautiful brood of ducklings, and his eye took them
and every one of them died, so I am putting these
out of sight in case he should look at them.”</p>

<p>According to one authority the influence of an
Evil Eye does not cease at once with the absence of
the possessor. “W. G. lived for some time on a
certain farm; she was supposed to be possessed of
the Evil Eye, and on one occasion it was particularly
noticed that certain animals she had praised died.
When removed from the farm, the farmer met with
a succession of misfortunes which were credited
to W. G.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CONVERSION_TO_BELIEF_IN_EVIL_EYE">CONVERSION TO BELIEF IN EVIL EYE</h2>
</div>


<p>We have already seen a case, in which a woman on
her own showing demonstrates that it was the influence
of others which caused her to believe in the
power of the Evil Eye; but conviction has in some
cases been carried to the minds of men as a result
of experience. A man taking a valuable horse from
the west coast of Kintyre to Tarbert was, after
leaving Musadale, offered a considerable sum for it.
He said he would not, could not sell the beast, and
though the offer was raised to sixty pounds, he still
refused and went on his way. Before he reached
Tayinloan the horse fell dead on the road. The
owner of the horse, considered to be a religious man,
after this incident could not be shaken in his belief
in the Evil Eye.</p>

<p>In another case, a woman having got from her
mother a hen, a first-rate layer, an acquaintance came
in and the conversation turned upon the excellence
of the bird, frankly acknowledged by the owner, who
added her own quota of praise. The visitor was no
time gone when the hen “clapped her wings, fell
down, and died.” Mrs. G. declared that it has been
her firm belief ever since that it was a case of
<i lang="gd">cronachadh</i>.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="GIVING_AWAY_MILK_DANGEROUS">GIVING AWAY MILK DANGEROUS</h2>
</div>


<p>All have heard of the belief in the power of witches
to acquire for themselves, among other things, the
milk and butter of their neighbours. This apparently
requires some deliberate act of magic, “drawing the
tether,” as they say in the north of Ireland, or even
milking the pot chain, as reported in the Highlands.
In only one case, as reported, was this danger ascribed
to the owner of an Evil Eye, and the writer is still
of opinion that his lady friend, who said, “If an
evil-disposed person who possesses an Evil Eye gets
a little milk from another, he or she will be able to
operate through that to injure all the milk that
remains, and even the cows,” had not differentiated
in her own mind the “Evil Eye” from “witchcraft.”
We will repeat the incident.</p>

<p>A suspected woman, living near, one time asked
her servant if she could get a little milk daily, her
own cow giving none at the time. The servant girl
told the lady that the woman was asking milk, and
then added, “I will not give it her.” Her mistress
said, “Oh, you may give it; she needs it, and you can
spare it quite well.” The girl said it was not that,
but showed that she was afraid of the woman getting
what she asked, and thus taking their milk from
them and perhaps injuring the cow. Her mistress
said there was no fear of that, and the girl yielded,
adding, “I know what I’ll do.” What she did was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>
to put pinches of salt and of sugar in the milk the
woman was to get that evening, and to take the
first mouthful (<i lang="gd">bolgam</i>) of it herself. This, according
to prevalent ideas in the district, would hinder the
receiver of the milk having any power to do harm
for the remainder of that season. This performance
seems a common precaution in cases where milk is
given to suspected persons.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="SCIENCE_VERSUS_EOLAS">SCIENCE VERSUS EOLAS</h2>
</div>


<p>It will be easily understood that to a believer in the
Evil Eye mere modern science, as met with in daily
life, in doctors, and veterinary surgeons, is of small
account. A well-educated lady, a friend of the writer,
advised a neighbour whose cow was ill to send for
the vet. The answer was: “<i lang="gd">Cha’n eil vet a chum feum
sam bith, oir ’san a tha bho air a cronachadh. ’S e rud
is fearr eolas fhaotainn air a son.</i>” (“A vet is no use
whatever, because the cow is <i lang="gd">air a cronachadh</i>; the
best thing is to get <i lang="gd">eolas</i> for it.)”</p>

<p>In that case they didn’t even send for the “vet.”
In the following instance a certain preliminary confidence
seems to have been shown in medical men.
The reciter gives this as a very clear case of Evil
Eye. A child had fallen sick; two doctors were
attending it, but it was getting worse. The parents,
having done all that they could think of, requested
the aid of a woman who was known to deal with
<i lang="gd">eolas a chronachaidh</i>. The woman went to see the
child, and what she did the reciter did not know,
but, “sure enough, she soon cured the child and
told its parents that it had been <i lang="gd">air a cronachadh</i>.”
This may have been “sure enough” for those immediately
interested, others may be permitted to
doubt.</p>

<p>In these cases common sense has generally the
minister on its side. In a case already quoted, in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>
which the mother’s milk was supposed to have been
turned into water in her system by the Tiree woman,
her mother was sent for. This old lady’s granddaughter
tells us, “When my grandmother came she
suggested that a decent man who was living near
them, who was used to work with <i lang="gd">eolas</i> where people
or beasts had been <i lang="gd">air an cronachadh</i>, should be called
in, but she said they would need to go to him
secretly, for he had promised the minister that he
would not make any more <i lang="gd">eolas</i>. My father and
mother agreed, but my mother requested my grandmother
to go to the man, because she did not know
how to go about it. My grandmother went and
spoke to the man’s wife first. The wife said, ‘I am
sure he will do what he can for John (the child’s
father), but he has promised the minister that he
would not make any more of that; but come and
speak to him yourself.’ My grandmother spoke to
the man, who said that he had promised to the
minister that he would not do any more of these
things. He could not go to her, but she might
come back to him again the following day. This
was a Wednesday, and there were only two days of
the week on which he could make <i lang="gd">eolas</i>—these were
Thursdays and Sundays. When she went back the
following day, he had not got his cure ready yet,
he said, but would have it on Sunday. He told her
that her daughter would not have so much milk as
she had at first, but would have enough to bring
up the child. On Sunday he had the thing ready
as he had promised, and he made it twice for her
afterwards. That is, he made it three times. He
correctly described the whole appearance of the
woman who had taken the milk away, although<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span>
nobody had ever mentioned about the Tiree <i lang="gd">cailleach</i>
to him. My mother had plenty of milk after that.”</p>

<p>We can scarcely wonder at the minister objecting
to this magical practitioner when we consider the
nature and the time of his performance. An old
Islay man says that when he was a young man he
was very intimate with a woman who had knowledge
of the curing of toothache (<i lang="gd">eolas deide</i>). She was a
relative of his own, and many a time she offered to
teach him the words she used. She could teach them
to a male, not to a female. He was young at the
time, and did not like to learn them, for some people
were saying that it was a sort of witchcraft (<i lang="gd">buideachas</i>),
but it was not that, for the words were all good words.
They were taught by the Saviour, who taught them
first to His mother. Our reciter went on to say that
this toothache cure is of no use, and need not be
tried, in any case beyond a first or second attack.
It is hard to make it succeed even in the case of a
second attack, and beyond that it can have no effect
whatever. Neither will it do in a case where the
sufferer has his tooth taken out.</p>

<p>These latter confessions were doubtless memories
of the instructions of the teacher. Our old friend did
not repeat the formula, but it has appeared elsewhere.<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>The “some” who said that <i lang="gd">eolas</i> was a sort of
witchcraft seem undoubtedly to be right, unless, of
course, we admit that their action is based on a
scientific understanding. The Evil Eye itself is unconscious,
and therefore a natural phenomenon like
measles or hay fever, but its cure is a good deal like
that employed for hay fever in many cases, more
empirical than scientific.</p>

<p>(“There is serpent knowledge (serpent bite) and

stitch (gripes) knowledge and hurt knowledge (by
Evil Eye or Witchcraft). Knowledge of each thing
in its own place. If any person is wounded by a
serpent let him get serpent knowledge, and when a
man has toothache let him get toothache knowledge,
and so with every other thing. I myself know two
or three who got a cure for serpent bites. The words
they have for curing stitch (gripes) are taken from
the New Testament, a bit here and a bit there, and
these written upon paper, and that paper sewn in
the inside of the coat of the person who had the
stitch. This will put the stitch away. I knew a
man that tried this, and it was of use to him. But
one must be sure that he has got the right words.
And the words for toothache knowledge are put on
paper, and the paper sewn inside a person’s clothes
in the same manner. But if the teeth are gone it
will do no good, but if they are still whole it will
do good, and the toothache will not return any
more.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span></p>

<p>“I have often heard the words they have for eye
knowledge, but I will give you what crowns the
whole, the thing a Mother gave to her Son to keep
evil away from the milk and from the churn. Here
are the words:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

    <div class="verse indent0">‘When you make a beginning</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Put a good handful of salt in it.</div>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“You see the witch Hendry was in the Bible. She
was the strongest witch that ever lived, but if any
person would get all these things and use them, she,
or any other witch, could not do him injury. I have
myself seen the red thread on children to keep evil
from them.”)</p>

<p>The above is undoubtedly sheer witchcraft, white
witchcraft, if you like. It is not then surprising that
the evidence is not in favour of these <i lang="gd">eolas</i> professors
being held in much social esteem. A native of Harris,
talking of one of them, said: “Notwithstanding the
wide reputation the man had, and the many who went
to seek advice, he was not held in high esteem, and
this part of his occupation was not admired although
so many took advantage of his services.” The reciter
himself spoke of him as <i lang="gd">bodach granda</i> (nasty old
man).</p>

<p>A Gaelic-speaking minister gave the following information.
It refers to Arran. He knew several old<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span>
women who professed <i lang="gd">eolas a chronachaidh</i>, but he did
not hold a high opinion of them. One case, however,
he remembers especially in this connection. A lad
was taken suddenly ill, supposed to be a case of
<i lang="gd">cronachadh</i>. An old woman, who was respected in
the district, came to see him, and going above him
in the bed, made motions with her hands over him
and on her own person, repeating an incantation of
some length at the same time. The lad recovered.
The reciter admits the fact, but does not incline to
accept the <i lang="gd">eolas</i> performance as having caused the
recovery.</p>

<p>A reciter in Mull was telling before her mother of
the operations of a <i lang="gd">cailleach</i> of this sort, when the
mother added, she herself had spoken with the
woman, she was a decent body, and assured her
that there was nothing whatever wrong in what she
did for the cure of cattle when hurt by the Evil Eye.
The words used were good, and she repeated them,
but she added that a great deal depended upon the
person who applied for <i lang="gd">eolas</i>, and that, unless such
a person believed that a cure would be effectual,
there was little use in what she herself could do, and
no use at all in the contents of the bottle which she
supplied. It might just as well be thrown out on
the roadside.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="HURTER_AND_HEALER">HURTER AND HEALER</h2>
</div>


<p>A farmer’s wife, an old woman, but smart and intelligent,
and showing no failure of memory, expressed
the following opinion:—</p>

<p>The power to do injury to beast or person, and the
power to cure such an injury appeared to have been
given to different classes of people. Those who did
injury were supposed to be malevolent, and of course
held in bad repute, while the curers were looked upon
as for the good of people and to be respected. What
the one did was called <i lang="gd">cronachadh</i>, and what the other
did <i lang="gd">beannachadh</i> (blessing).</p>

<p>To another, an Islay lady, the remark was made
that <i lang="gd">cronachadh</i> was a strange thing. In answer she
said: “Yes, but <i lang="gd">beannachadh</i> was quite as strange.”
“What is that?” “<i lang="gd">Fiosrachadh or eolas.</i>” (Knowledge
the result of inquiry, and knowledge apparently arrived
at in any way, say by revelation.)</p>

<p>That is one side of the picture. We see the other
in the following:—</p>

<p>“There was a lad at service at one time with
Malcolm here beside us. He was one of the T’s.
He was in the habit of coming to this house, and my
father said to myself, I should not have too much to
do with him, for that there was something bad in him.
It was maintained that his father had <i lang="gd">eolas</i>, and people
would be going to him when a beast or person was unwell,
but those that have the one thing, the knowledge<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span>
of healing, it is usual for them to have the other thing,
knowledge to cause injury also.” The reciter believed
that this lad deliberately did them an injury, and after
recounting the particulars said, “My father advised us
not to show any anger to the lad for fear he might do
something worse to us, if he were to know that we were
angry. ‘That is the way the like of these people have.
If they do harm to a person and he shows anger they
will do him more harm.’”</p>

<p>A domestic servant, speaking of an old woman that
she knew very well, said: “She was known as Mairi
Siath (Mary of sprains?) and was looked upon as
one who had a great deal of secret power by which she
could do both harm and good. People were afraid to
offend her, and would give her almost anything she
would ask rather than offend her.” The said Mary,
having been consulted about unsuccessful churning,
“brought back the butter every bit that should have
been on the churn from the time it had been taken
away, and there was so much that the mistress was
afraid to use it in the house, for she said it could not
have come in a right way. She gave it away, and after
that they always got butter on the churn.”</p>

<p>There is no doubt that the girl who repeated this
believed what she was telling as of her own knowledge.
The only explanation that occurs to one is
that the milk, having been for some reason poor for a
time from bad feeding or some such thing, the food
having become better and richer, the milk was thereby
improved to such an extent as to give the appearance,
especially in comparison with the small yield before,
of a somewhat supernatural supply.</p>

<p>The same belief in the power of hurting and healing
being united in one person has been already<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span>
mentioned in connection with an Arran shepherd
on page 19.</p>

<p>One other case as reported was that of an Islay
farmer who, on one occasion riding along the road,
passed a man ploughing with a pair of horses.
Shortly thereafter the horses lay down, having become
to all appearance unwell. A messenger was
immediately despatched after the farmer, who, hearing
what had happened, returned, and at any rate
got the credit of curing the animals.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="TRANSMISSION_OF_EOLAS">TRANSMISSION OF EOLAS</h2>
</div>


<p>It has already been mentioned how a woman who
possessed a toothache cure was willing to impart
the necessary formula (incantation) to a “relative”
who was a male, but could not do it to a female.
That case was in Islay.</p>

<p>The following information from Skye shows the
belief that <i lang="gd">eolas</i> is imparted in the same way and
under like circumstances there. This Skye woman
was believed to have the Evil Eye, and to have the
power of taking away the produce (<i lang="gd">an toradh</i>) from
other’s cows. When she was on her deathbed, and
when she came very near her end, she said to those
about her that she was anxious to see her husband.
He happened at that particular time to be out looking
after something, and they sent for him, but all the
time till he came in she kept crying for him, and
urging that she wished to see him. When he came
in she requested that all the others should withdraw,
and when they had done so she said to her husband
to shut the door that there might be nobody there but
themselves alone. What took place between them
there nobody ever knew, but one thing people firmly
believed, that was that she gave the skill that she
had to her husband, for after that he could take away
the <i lang="gd">toradh</i> from other people’s cows, and did take it
away too.</p>

<p>However, authorities do not always agree as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span>
to changing the sex in the transmission of this
magic.</p>

<p>A native of Harris, a woman of about forty, has
no English, and can neither read nor write. When
asked as to her experiences, and if she had ever seen
a thread tied round a child’s neck to preserve it
from the effects of the Evil Eye, she said: “I did see
it; wasn’t there one on my own child? and that was
for A. McE.‘s Evil Eye. She has an Evil Eye (<i lang="gd">Droch
shuil</i>), and one day she came into the house and
began to praise the child greatly. She was only a
short time gone when the child began to vomit.
‘O Kate,’ said I to my sister, ‘my child is <i lang="gd">air a
cronachadh</i> with the Evil Eye of that woman.’ ‘If
that is all that is wrong, we won’t be long putting
it right,’ said Kate, and she took a red thread, and
when she had said the word, she tied the string on
the child’s neck, and there was no time till it was
quite well.” She was asked whether Kate had the
words, and she replied, “Oh yes, my mother had
them and she taught them to Kate.”</p>

<p>The general trend of belief is that the hereditary
transmission of <i lang="gd">eolas</i> is from father to daughter, and
from mother to son. A reciter said: “A woman still
lives in the neighbourhood, said to have obtained
her <i lang="gd">eolas</i> secret from her father. She is often requisitioned,
and her skill to cure fully believed in.”</p>

<p>Another said: “You know A. McE. His mother
had <i lang="gd">eolas a chronachaidh</i>, and he said that she left the
secret with him before she died.” These were “unprovoked”
statements of the reciters, and in the latter
case the interest of the story was in pointing out
the method taken to determine whose Evil Eye had
affected a sick horse. The owner was told to watch<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span>
the colour of the hair of the first woman that passed
the house, which would be the same as that of the
person wanted. The result was given in the following
terms, “Now she is blaming Mrs. MacD.”</p>

<p>In all these cases we see that the <i lang="gd">eolas</i> was kept
in the family, or at least believed to be so. The
deathbed scene of the wife and husband may be a
most uncharitable suggestion of heathenism, but the
recital was made in good faith.</p>

<p>The witch doctor sometimes apparently requires
assistance. A horse being taken ill while ploughing,
supposed to be hurt by the Evil Eye, the farmer
refused to have anything to do with these irregular
practices. The horse died. Not long after a second
took ill, and as the ploughman, the reciter, said, “We
were all about it saying it could be cured.” At last
the master said if there was any person who could
do it they might try it, it would do no harm at any
rate. There was a man there that had <i lang="gd">eolas</i>, and he
took another man out with him, and they made the
<i lang="gd">eolas</i> outside. They did nothing to the horse, but
while they were out making the <i lang="gd">eolas</i> the horse got
up, shook itself, and was better at once.</p>

<p>In Arran, as elsewhere, <i lang="gd">cronachadh</i> seems to be
regarded as hereditary. One reciter said of a man
at Loch Ranza that it did not matter what he would
look at, his look would <i lang="gd">cronach</i> it. A lad from another
part of the island went to ask a daughter of this man
to marry him, and when the nearest neighbour heard
of his courtship she became exceedingly angry, and
protested against any of that man’s daughters being
brought there “to <i lang="gd">cronaich</i> everything about the
place.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="FORMS_OF_INCANTATION">FORMS OF INCANTATION</h2>
</div>


<p>For specimens of these incantations the reader should
refer to “Gaelic Incantations, with Translations,”
W. Mackenzie, Inverness, 1895; and to “Carmina
Gadelica,” A. Carmichael, Edinburgh, 1900. Above
we have already given one as recited, but they are
hard to get, there being many reasons why the user
is shy of repeating them. One thing is certain, that
a complete performance of any of these rites requires
the repetition of “words,” as they say, of some sort.
In far the majority of cases, the words are what
are called “good” words, having a sanction of Christianity
about them, being generally invocations of
the Trinity and of Mary. As a native of Morven said,
describing a cure in which water is used at a certain
stage, “The person making the <i lang="gd">eolas</i> kept saying good
words.” Another woman from Mull, describing a cure
done by herself, said: “I remember a child I cured
myself with good words that I have. It was very
ill, and nearly gone when I took it and placed it in
my bosom and cured it. I said the words over it,
but after curing it I was very much exhausted
until I got a cup of tea, and then I felt myself
getting better.” When requested to repeat the
words, she affirmed that they were all good words,
and that it was in the name of the Trinity she did
it; but she went over the words in such a low
voice, and with so indistinct a pronunciation and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span>
so fast, that the collector found it quite impossible
to follow.</p>

<p>The writer was mentioning these circumstances to
a lady visiting him who gave the following example,
which aptly illustrates how the performance of some
ceremony can form a foundation for belief in their
beneficial activity. Her sister’s child of three weeks
old was lying exceedingly ill and two medical men
were in attendance, one having been called in as a
consultant.</p>

<p>They told my visitor themselves that the child
could not live. The family are Scotch, but this
occurred in the neighbourhood of London. The
monthly nurse suggested and urged baptism. The
clergyman was sent for, and while going through
the ceremony the child, who had been lying motionless,
made some slight movement. Within two
days that child had recovered, and is at the time
of writing this as many years old as it was then
weeks. The consultant subsequently expressed his
dissatisfaction with the infant for having belied his
prognosis.</p>

<p>In a case from Mull a servant, having been sent
for a means of cure to a woman supposed to have
skill, she found her in bed. She sat up, took the
bottle containing water which had been sent for,
put the mouth of it to her own mouth, and began
to say some words over it. The words were spoken
in a low tone, but so far as was recognised they
were all “good” words.</p>

<p>In the case of a sick horse already quoted, the
man who saw it went at once for G. T., then herding
in the neighbourhood. The description of the interview<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span>
is as follows: “When I reached him he said,
‘Peter, you need not tell me your business here.’
I said, ‘No.’ We went together to a little stream,
and he said that I might now tell him what had
brought me. When I told him, he asked me if I
had tobacco. They do nothing without pay; not
money, but tobacco and things like that. I knew
he would ask for it, and I had it with me, and when
I gave it him he asked if I had a bottle. I had a
good notion of every turn he had, and so had taken
a bottle with me, and when I gave it to him he
turned his back to me and began lifting the water
and saying the words. There was not a bad word
in all he said, no, no. He said to me when he gave
me the bottle and told me how to use it, ‘Your
horse will be all right, Peter, as soon as you use
it.’” His statement came true.</p>

<p>Things are not, however, always reported as of
such an innocent and Christian character. A collector
happened to be present at a conversation
between two believers in the Evil Eye. One of
them said, “Those who are working at such as that,
applying <i lang="gd">eolas</i>, are not helped but by the ‘bad one,’
for if it were that they were doing good they would
not need to be hiding themselves when they would
be at it. P. McL., a decent man, said his cow was
injured, and sent for A. T. The cow was in a little
hut, and when A. went in where the cow was P.
put his ear to a little window that was in the wall,
and he said, that when he heard such language as
A. had, he would never again send for her should
every cow he would have be unwell. She put her
cap under her two knees—she was bare-headed and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span>
with her knees bare, but kneeling on her cap apparently—and
she prayed to the vile one. (‘<i lang="gd">Ghuidh
i ris an fhear mhosach.</i>’) B. said, ‘Was that the
time she said that my father’s brother injured the
cow?’ That was the very time. You were living
beside P. then.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="FORM_OF_PAYMENT">FORM OF PAYMENT</h2>
</div>


<p>“The labourer is worthy of his hire.” A case has
been already given where the reciter said that nothing
was done without pay, but not of money. We must
not generalise in that way. A native of Tiree says,
speaking of his experience in the cure of a horse of
his father’s, “All these <i lang="gd">eolas</i> folk must get a piece of
silver. It may be a shilling or two shillings. This
they say makes the cure more certain, and they
cannot promise a cure without it. The lad took with
him a two-shilling piece and went to an <i lang="gd">eolas</i> man
who lived five miles away.”</p>

<p>Apparently the silver is given in the form of money
as the most convenient medium, though there is good
reason for the supposition that the whiteness of
silver makes it specially appropriate as a medium of
remuneration.</p>

<p>The instance in which the child that was ill is
described as if singing “do re do,” the woman who
cured it received from the father tea and sugar which
he had taken with him when he went to consult her;
but she said to “my man” (it was the mother who
recited the incident) “that she was not wanting anything
and would do it for us for nothing, but that he would
need to come back with white silver. I sent him
back with a sixpence to give her.”</p>

<p>An innkeeper, a well-read, shrewd woman of about
five-and-forty, tells of a case with which she was well<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span>
acquainted in which a near neighbour consulted an
old man, wanting him to bring back her butter.
“She said that she would pay him if he would bring
it back to her.” He said that he did not want payment,
but at the same time he could not bring it back
unless he were paid in silver for doing so; that
being so, he would require to take something from
her, as otherwise the cure would not be successful.
So she gave him the silver and soon had all the
butter that she lost.“</p>

<p>Another reciter having been accustomed to do the
churning in his father’s house, after his father’s death,
his stepmother sent for him because she herself
could not get any butter from the churn. He did
his best, but was unsuccessful. Having had a horse
cured by <i lang="gd">eolas</i>, he suggested that the same man should
be consulted. The man arrived, and the case was explained,
the woman stating, “<i lang="gd">Feuch gun toir sibh dhachaidh
an toradh oir tha e air falbh.</i>” (“Try if you can
bring back the due produce, for it is gone.”) “I’ll do
that,” he said, and he did it by his <i lang="gd">eolas</i>; there was
plenty butter on the churn. It cost the woman a
crown, but if it did, that was better than that the
butter should be lost.</p>

<p>A woman who prepared a bottle for a sick cow
charged the man who consulted her “two shillings
for the bottle, and when she took the money she
poured a little water on it and spat on it.” She
might, one would think, with advantage have changed
the order of her proceedings.</p>

<p>A sick bull which the veterinary surgeon had
given up was referred to an <i lang="gd">eolas</i> woman, the
principal argument being that her assistance “would
only cost a shilling.” She ordered a bucket of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span>
water to be thrown over the animal, and it recovered.</p>

<p>A Mull woman tells how her grandmother when
newly married, after having reared calves, could only
get butter of such an ugly colour that nobody would
eat it, and it was used for greasing wool before carding.
She was asked by a neighbour for a bowl of
butter one day, and accused of greed for refusing it
while she had eight cows. She explained the position,
and was then advised to consult an old man, the
neighbour adding that she would be coming back in
a fortnight, when there would be plenty of butter to
give her. The results of the consultation were fairly
successful, though the <i lang="gd">eolas</i> man explained that she
would not for that year have so much butter as she
should have, but that she should consider herself
lucky that her cattle had not died. The reciter then
said that her grandmother gave the man “plenty for
his trouble, but did not grudge it.” When the old
woman called on her way back she said, “Well, you
can give me the butter now.” To which her friend
replied, “Yes, I am thankful to you that I can.” And
she gave her a good bowl of butter.</p>

<p>In the above case payment seems to have been in
kind. A native of Ardnamurchan tells of a neighbour
of her mother’s who had a number of cows and lost
the due product of the whole of them. Her mother’s
people were sitting down to dinner when a beggar
woman came and asked, “<i lang="gd">An sibhse a’ bhoirionnach a
chaill an toradh?</i>” (“Are you the woman who has
lost the milk and butter?”) “My mother was very
fond of her neighbour, and thinking she might find
out on her behalf how the milk might be got back,
she answered that she was. The beggar woman said,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span>
‘<i lang="gd">Ma bheir sibh dhomh lan meise de mhin bheir mise air
ais dhuibh e.</i>’ (‘If you will give me a (wooden) dishful
of meal I will bring it back to you.’) My mother
said that she would give her all that was on the table
if she would bring it back, and then ran to the neighbour’s
house to tell what she had heard. They
returned together and told the beggar woman whose
cows really had been ill.” They are said to have
been cured. Here also the payment was promised
in kind.</p>

<p>A native of Harris tells us of an old man in Stornoway
much consulted, who “would undertake for so
much money to bring milk and butter back.”</p>

<p>An Islay man gives us “<i lang="gd">ni a chunnaic mise mi fein</i>”
(“a thing I saw my own self”). This was the cure of
his father’s cow. A certain George T. “came the way”
“<i lang="gd">b’e duine corr bha ann an Deorsa so, aig an robh moran
sgil mu’n chronachaidh</i>.” (“This George was a decent
man, he had much skill about <i lang="gd">cronachadh</i>.”) The cure
is described, and the reciter continued: “<i lang="gd">Cha b’e duine
bha’ n an Deorsa a ghabhadh rud sam bith: ’se sin cha
ghabhadh e pris airson a sheirbhis ann a leithid so do ni.</i>”
(“George was not a man that would take anything for
his service in such a thing as this.”) “And my mother
said to him, ‘Will you take a cup of tea, George?’
‘It is I that will,‘ he said, for he had been about the
cow a long time. When they were taking the tea
they were keeping an eye on the cow now and again.
She took a long time that she did not bend down her
head, but at last she gave a shake to herself, and
George said to my mother, ‘Your cow is right,
woman.’ In a little while she gave the next shake,
and again the third shake, and with that she was as
well as she had ever been.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="THE_NECESSITY_OF_FAITH">THE NECESSITY OF FAITH</h2>
</div>


<p>A native of Lewis who professed disbelief in the
Evil Eye, though she knew numbers who did believe,
was advised when her cow was ill to send for a
skilled woman. She refused. A woman who was
in the habit of assisting when they were busy, being
told she might do as she liked, went to the <i lang="gd">eolas</i>
woman. When our reciter, Mrs. McN., looked into
the byre shortly afterwards she found the servant
girl and the occasional assistant hiding a bottle. “I
asked them what they had in the bottle. The
woman answered that she had just gone to K. McI.
for <i lang="gd">eolas</i>, and that that was what was in the bottle.
They had put it in the cow’s ears and over her back
in the name of the Trinity, and the woman remarked
that if it would not do good it would do no harm at
any rate. I told them again that I did not believe
in it at all, and as it turned out I did not need to
believe it, for the cow died not long after. But if I
did not believe the woman did, and so did the person
who had made the <i lang="gd">eolas</i>, and they maintained that it
was because I did not believe in it that it failed to
cure the cow, for it is believed the success of <i lang="gd">eolas a
chronachaidh</i> in its attempts to cure depends much
upon whether it is believed in or not.”</p>

<p>Compare this with the statement of another reciter,
who on hearing of a case of cure said, “When I was
herding, one of the cows was <i lang="gd">air a cronachadh</i>, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span>
the people did not believe in <i lang="gd">eolas</i>, and if it had not
been that some of the neighbours went to A. T.
the cow was dead.”</p>

<p>In another case in which the owner of the sick
cow said that there was many a thing that might
happen to a beast, and that she did not believe that
the cow had been hurt by the Evil Eye. A friend
persisted in her opinion that it was the Evil Eye,
and when the reciter’s mother refused to send for
<i lang="gd">eolas</i>, the woman went off herself and came back
with a bottle which she sprinkled on the cow, and
in less than an hour the cow was eating as well as
ever, and before the water had been put on her she
was groaning and would neither eat nor move. The
probability is, of course, that if no success had
followed the application of the remedy, want of
faith on the part of the owner might have been
urged as a reason for failure.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="PREVENTING_EVIL_BY_BLESSING">PREVENTING EVIL BY BLESSING</h2>
</div>


<p>A young man who could read and write, the son of
a decidedly superstitious father, said if any one were
praising another person’s beast, and danger was
suspected, because praising by one that has an Evil
Eye is dangerous, if the owners say “God bless it”
that would prevent any mischief happening.</p>

<p>A native of Bernera (Harris) mentioned as among
the ordinary precautions effective against the Evil
Eye a person blessing himself. While another mentioned
the keeping of ripe rowans (<i lang="gd">caorain dearg</i>)
beside him, or regularly blessing himself and his
belongings, as sufficient to prevent any injury coming
to him from the Evil Eye or Witchcraft. This
blessing seems to have been done in quite a formal
way. An old believer who can read Gaelic remembers
having seen cattle blessed for the purpose of keeping
away evil, and when she was young it was common
in the district where she was brought up, when
neighbours visited one another, for the visitor on
entering the house to bless both the house and the
people living in it. In this connection she told the
following story: “There was at one time living in
the Harris district of Islay a gentleman trained in
the knowledge of the ‘Black Art’ (<i lang="gd">Sgoil Dhubh</i>). He
visited the Laird of Balinaby and took from every
cow on his estate its due produce (<i lang="gd">toradh</i>). He and
the Laird passed this cow, and the visitor remarked:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span>
‘You have a witch on the estate.’ ‘No,’ said the
Laird. ‘Oh yes, there is no doubt of it.’ ‘Well, if
there is, it is without my knowledge.’ ‘To whom
does that cow belong?’ ‘To a widow that lives in
the house over there.’ ‘Well, she must be a witch,
for I can take the produce from every cow on the
place except that one, but I am beat with her.’”</p>

<p>Balinaby called at the woman’s house and asked
her what she did to protect her cow. “I do nothing,”
said the woman. “You must do something, for I
find that the <i lang="gd">toradh</i> can be taken from every cow on
the farm but yours.” “Well,” said she, “I am a
God-fearing woman, and am thankful to have the
cow. Every morning I pray that she may be preserved,
and when I go to milk her I bless myself
and the cow. That is all I do.” This is evidently
traditional, and is quoted merely as an evidence of
belief in the protection granted to those who audibly
place themselves under the protection of the Deity.</p>

<p>It is a curious fact that Balinaby (the Abbot’s
Town), bulks very largely in the supernatural folklore
of Islay.</p>

<p>A native of Tarbat, Ross-shire, already quoted
as telling of a child taken ill because the visitor had
not blessed it, details that visitor’s action for the
cure of the child, when taxed with the dereliction,
as follows. “She asked a bowl from my mother
and a silver coin, which she got. She put the coin
in the bowl, and going to the bedside where the
child was lying, sprinkled the water on the child’s
face, and wet her lips and the palms of both her
hands. While doing this she blessed the child, repeated
some words over it, and in a little while the
bairn was quite well and as brisk as ever.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span></p>

<p>The materials used in this cure will be considered
in more detail, but the blessing was evidently an important
part of it to repair a neglect in the first
instance.</p>

<p>An old lady in Arran remembers being told of an
older generation who, desiring not to injure their own
or another’s beast lest there should be evil in their eye
unknown to themselves, always took the precaution
of blessing the animal before looking at it. The
words they used were “<i lang="gd">Gum beannaicheadh Dia am
beathach</i>” (“That God may bless the beast”), or “<i lang="gd">Gum
beannaicheadh Dia an ni air am bheil mo shuil ag
amhairc</i>.” (“May God bless the thing my eye is
regarding.”)</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="PREVENTING_BY_DISPRAISING">PREVENTING BY DISPRAISING</h2>
</div>


<p>The expression of a blessing seems to be merely a
preventative, which of course is better than curative,
if we accept the general proverb. Another preventative,
when the expression of praise seems likely to be
hurtful, is to miscall the animal spoken of. A man
ploughing, who thought very well of his horses, said
to his master on seeing another he knew approaching,
“Here comes ——, and he will ruin both the horses if
he can, for he has the Evil Eye.” His master said,
“I’ll tell you what you will do, and if you do it he can
do the horses no harm. When he begins to praise
either or both just begin to run them down, and be
sure you say as much against them as he shall say for
them.” He of the Evil Eye came up, and commencing
with “What a fine pair of horses you have,”
went on to enumerate their good points. The servant
objected that they looked better than they were, that
their looks were the best of them, and for every point
in their favour the other mentioned, the lad said something
to counterbalance it. The other began to show
signs of impatience, and went on his way not very well
pleased with the way his opinions of the horses had
been disputed. “Well done, you have saved the
horses,” said his master. “Did I do it right?” said
the lad. “Yes, indeed, you could not have said more
than you have said.”</p>

<p>A native of Campbeltown is the authority for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span>
following. Mrs. M’F. from Knapdale resided in
Glasgow for some time after her marriage. She was
standing at the mouth of the close one day with her
first child in her arms when a little woman whom she
had never seen before, and never saw again, as far as
she knows, came across the street, and looking at the
child began to praise it for its beauty. Mrs. M’F. had
not the presence of mind to praise it above what the
other woman said, nor to miscall it. Had she done
either it would have prevented mischief. As it was,
the child began to cry as soon as the little woman
went away. It continued crying for a day and a half,
and never was right afterwards. The child died.
Mrs. M’F. was quite certain it had been injured by
the eye of the little woman.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="PREVENTING_BY_ROWAN_AND">PREVENTING BY ROWAN AND
JUNIPER</h2>
</div>


<p>Every one knows of the value of the rowan tree as
a preventative of witchcraft. It is equally effective
apparently against the Evil Eye. It is scarcely worth
while dilating on this, but it would not do to neglect
it. A resident in the Chanonry had a near neighbour
terribly suspicious of interference with her cow. She
would never allow a cow away from her own ground
until she had first tied a sprig of rowan to its tail.</p>

<p>A native of Kintyre, the opposite side of the
country, connects this observance with May Eve, on
which occasion it was common to tie a sprig of
rowan to the cattle’s tails. Above we have mentioned
rowan berries as equally efficacious with a blessing.
The rowan is tied to churns as well as to cows’ tails.
Another reciter mentions a case in which, along with
a bottle, a professor of <i lang="gd">eolas</i> “went to the back
of his house, taking a thin slice of juniper wood
(<i lang="gd">iubhar beinne</i>), which he instructed was to be put
between the wood of the churn and one of its
hoops.”</p>

<p>One cannot help speculating as to what may
have caused the use of these plants. We have a
hint from the Chanonry that the rowan tree was
attached when the cow left her own ground. Now
cows leave their owners’ ground solely when sent
to the bull. In connection with the <i lang="gd">iubhar</i>, attention<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span>
is called to the curious, incomprehensible shinty
formula in which the word iubhar occurs:—</p>

<p><i lang="gd">Ciod an caman?</i> (What shinty-club?)</p>

<p><i lang="gd">Caman iubhair</i> (Shinty-club of yew).</p>

<p><i lang="gd">Ciod an t-iubhar?</i> (What yew?)</p>

<p><i lang="gd">Iubhar athair</i> (Yew of air),</p>

<p>of which another reciter gave the slightly altered pronunciation,
<i lang="gd">iubhar athar</i> (father’s yew).<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>A native of the Lewis says it was pretty common
to protect cows from evil influences by the use of
a charmed <i lang="gd">burrach</i> (cow fetter). The <i lang="gd">burrach</i> was
made of different things, and when a cow calved it
was fixed on her hind legs.</p>

<p>The <i lang="gd">burrachs</i> the writer has seen were made of
hair, possibly they may have made them upon
occasion of some tough wood.</p>

<p>Note that it was in calving that the charmed
<i lang="gd">burrach</i> was of advantage, and thus the observances
for the protection of the cattle are solely connected
with their increase.</p>

<p>An Arran reciter said: “I was one time staying with
a friend here, and I noticed that a horse nail was
tied round the churn. I mentioned nothing about
it till one day when washing the churn I said, ‘I
suppose I may take this off,’ but would she let me,
though she did not tell me why it had been put on,
but I soon found that out for myself.”</p>

<p>Another authority mentions not the nail but the
whole shoe. “The produce of the churn may be
effectually protected from the Evil Eye by nailing
the shoe of a colt or of an ass to the bottom of the
churn. Where this is done there are not on earth
that can do it harm, and many people always took
care not to expose their churn without a shoe of
either a colt or an ass nailed to it.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="PREVENTING_BY_A_SMALL_GIFT">PREVENTING BY A SMALL GIFT</h2>
</div>


<p>A well-informed woman, an innkeeper, said that
in cases where a person possessed of the Evil Eye
admired anything belonging to another, no injury
could follow if some little present were given to the
suspected person on leaving.</p>

<p>Another, the daughter of a farmer, an office-bearer
in the Church, in the same island, gave the same information,
but quoting an older authority. Beside
her father’s house was a woman who firmly believed
in the Evil Eye, and the power of preventing it by
this gift. The house commanded a view of the road,
so that, for the most part, an old woman suspected
who lived in the neighbourhood could generally be
seen approaching. The woman, to whom the latter
was a special object of suspicion, never failed to advise
our reciter’s people of the visitor’s advent. Her
advice was invariably given earnestly and in the same
form: “<i lang="gd">A ghraidh thoir ni eigin dhi, cha’n eil odds cho
beag no cho suarach a bhios e, ach thoir ni eigin dhi agus
an sin cha’n urrainn i do chron a dheanamh</i>.” (“Dear,
give her something, no odds how little or how trifling,
but give her something, and then she cannot do you
an injury.”)</p>

<p>In the case of churning the small present naturally
takes the form of a drink of milk to be given to
any one suspected of the Evil Eye, and so a reciter
said that one should always, for safety’s sake, give a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span>
visitor a drink of milk, and stated further that the
beneficial effect was added to if the one who gives it
first take a little of it herself before handing it to the
stranger. As an illustrative incident the reciter told
how Black Colin of Balinaby when out hunting
happened to go to Balimony at the milking time.
Not one of them offered him a drink of milk, “<i lang="gd">Ach
coma leat</i>” (But all the same) the following morning
when the girls went to milk the cows not a drop of
milk could they get, while the cows kept running and
roaring as if they were mad. At once the man of
Balimony, concluding that the mischief had been
done by Black Colin, saddled a horse, rode to
Balinaby and took all the milk from the Balinaby
cows, transferring it to his own. When Colin saw
this he wrote to Balimony to this effect: “<i lang="gd">Leig
leamsa agus leigidh mise leatsa</i>” (equivalent to “Let a
be for let a be”). The reciter added that the milk
was properly distributed thereafter, and that the
incident was one of Black Art.</p>

<p>To a student of the old Bardic Irish stories the
continual mention of those who are recommended
for their liberality to the poetic class simply shows
how they used their office for their own advantage.
The tricks of the non-producers continue the same
now as they were in the days of Cairbre. A poor
Bodach passed the house of the manager of a detached
farm. He asked if he could get a drink. The
manager’s wife, who was churning at the time, left
her churn and gave him a drink of water. The
Bodach took his drink and went away, the woman
went back to her churn, but let her churn ever so
much not a bit of butter could she get. The milk
became merely froth, and swelled up so that she filled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span>
all her spare dishes. That churning was no good,
nor the next, nor many succeeding ones, till she was
afraid to look at her churn. So things were when
who should appear but the same old man with the
same request. The manager himself being in, translated
the request liberally and gave him plenty both
to eat and drink. After resting a little the old man
rose to go away, and thanking them for their hospitality,
added, “If a poor man ask for a drink, do not
give him a drink of water.” The significant tone
suggested to the manager to ask him for advice as to
bringing back the butter, offering him any reasonable
reward and putting a piece of money into his hand.
This he said he would soon do, and told him to tell his
wife to clean her dishes and put a piece of money in
the churn and churn the next day. The story goes
on to say that every scrap that had been lost was got
back in one churning.</p>

<p>As the story is told the product of each churning
must have been but a small matter, but there can be
little doubt that this, if not a Bardic praise of hospitality,
is a beggar’s one, and the story of course no
better than an <i lang="gd">ursgeul</i>. The reciter added a comment
of her own: “<i lang="gd">Anns na laithean sin cha bhiodh daoine
a beannachadh an cuid, agus le sin bha e furasda gu leor
an cronachadh</i>.” (“In those days people were not in
the habit of blessing their effects, and so it was an
easy matter to do them harm.”) No doubt those were
the days before the existence of a Free Church, but
it is doubtful if there was much less expression of
blessings then than in the present.</p>

<p>Allusion has already been made, on an Islay authority,
to the efficacy of burning a piece of the clothing
to avert injury from any one bringing bad news
(page <a href="#Page_15">15</a>). A Tiree reciter gives the same information
a little more fully, and says it protects against witchcraft
or the Evil Eye. “If any woman comes into
a house who is suspected, those of the house should
try to get a small piece of some article of her
clothing, without letting her know that they have
got it, and throw it on the fire; that will prevent
her from taking anything away with her or leave
any mischief when she goes away. If they cannot
manage to get a bit of her own clothing, a good
plan is, when she is leaving, to burn a rag of some
kind of cloth in the fire and throw it after her as
she goes.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="PREVENTION_BY_SPITTING">PREVENTION BY SPITTING</h2>
</div>


<p>A native of Ross-shire and a minister gives the
following information. When he was living in K.
a woman there had a child of about nine months
old. Another woman came in, and looking at the
child on its mother’s arm, remarked, “<i lang="gd">Tha balach
boidheach priseil agad an sin</i>.” (“You have a pretty,
dear boy there.”) Without more ado the mother
turned the child’s face to her and began to spit in
it as hard as she could to prevent any bad effect
from the other woman’s Evil Eye. The reciter said
he has, in several places, heard of this being done
with the view of preventing harm, and he has often
heard a person in the Isle of Skye say “<i lang="gd">Fliuch do
shuil</i>” (“Wet your eye”) when any person praised
any of his cattle. The idea was that this would put
away the chance of mischief.</p>

<p>A native of Mull describes the practice as common
there, particularly as a preventative of injury to young
children. Spit on your finger and rub an eye of
the child to be protected with the moistened finger.
This was called <i lang="gd">fliuch an t-suil</i> (eye wet), and was
commonly practised and believed by many to be a
sufficient protection.</p>

<p>A farmer’s daughter, whose people have been for
generations in the same place in Islay, tells how she
was scandalised by this practice. “We had a web
of cloth to sew for the boys, and the tailor we took<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span>
in had the name of the Evil Eye. One day he was
sitting on the table sewing, and my brother came
into the kitchen to wash himself. He was but a
boy at the time, and stripped to his waist. C. B.
began to say that his skin was very white, and
he was looking very well. <i lang="gd">‘Fliuch do shuil, ’s na
cronaich mi,’ ars H.</i> (‘Wet your eye, and do not
blight me,’ said H.) ‘They will be saying, that if a
body will say that when any one who has an Evil
Eye is praising them, the Evil Eye can do them
no injury.’ Well, when H. said that, my mother
did not know where she was standing, she was so
much ashamed. You see the man had the name;
if it had not been for that she would not have
cared much.”</p>

<p>But the performance of the full ceremony is
still in use, and it is interesting to be able to
give the personal experience of my energetic co-worker,
to whom I am under so much obligation.</p>

<p>“A native of the Long Island was complimented
by me (E. M. K.) recently on the style of her
dress, and the smart appearance it gave her, when,
to my surprise and amusement, stepping forward
and wetting the point of her finger by putting it
on her tongue, she placed the finger on my right
eye, saying: ‘<i lang="gd">Fliuch do shuil eagal gum bi mi air mo
ghonadh</i>.’ (‘Wet your eye for fear that I may be
wounded.’) She did this very good-naturedly, and
explained that when one is the subject of what he
may suspect to be envious praise, either in respect
of person or clothing, he may protect himself from
consequences that might result from the Evil Eye,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span>
by performing this ceremony on the one who has
done the praising.”</p>

<p>It would appear that this practice is comparable
with the quenching of a cinder in water—by wetting,
the fire of the eye may be supposed to be extinguished
beneficially for the one on whom it might
have an evil influence.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="PREVENTING_BY_CHURNING">PREVENTING BY CHURNING</h2>
</div>


<p>It is specially difficult to distinguish between the Evil
Eye and witchcraft in the case of loss of the due
produce of cattle—butter, cream, &amp;c. Certain preventatives
are good for both. When any one is
churning and a visitor enters to whom any suspicion
is attached of the power of interfering with the butter,
any such power can be taken from her by getting her
to do a spell of the churning. A woman, a strong
believer in witchcraft and the Evil Eye, invariably
if she happens to go into a house where churning is
going on, takes the churn staff and gives a pull at the
churn, believing, by this means, that she frees herself
from suspicion if the churning go wrong. This
woman, though a professed believer in witchcraft and
the Evil Eye, neither professes practising it nor has
ever been suspected by others.</p>

<p>An Excise officer in Islay kept some cattle. The
servant was churning, but though there was an appearance
of butter, it could not be brought to anything.
The mistress of the house wondered what
had come over the milk, and a neighbour said that
a woman who lived in the neighbourhood, credited
with the Evil Eye, had been in, and added, the best
plan was to send for her and get her to take a spell at
the churn, which would neutralise any bad influence
she might have exerted. Acting on this advice, the
woman was sent for, and on coming was requested<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span>
to give a turn at the churn. She did not seem to be
very willing, but no further remark being made, she
took the churn staff and churned for a while, and the
butter was got all right.</p>

<p>Another woman who was present when this was
told doubted it being in anybody’s power to do harm
in that way, whereupon the reciter declared that she
believed it to be quite true and had experienced it
with the same woman, and then detailed how she had
caused the fowls to drop soft-shelled eggs, already
quoted.</p>

<p>A domestic servant, speaking of this churning difficulty,
said that when she went into houses where they
were churning they would not mind her. “Many a
time,” she added, “they have asked me to give them
help with the churn.” She apparently had not appreciated
the reason of her assistance being asked.</p>

<p>The explanation suggested for this procedure is,
that if one does not want the churning to be successful
they will not do anything to assist it; and, <i>vice
versâ</i>, if they do give their help it is considered as
evidence of their desire to bring it to a successful
termination.</p>

IN CLOTHES</h2>
</div>


<p>When speaking of the liability of nice-looking, well-dressed
children suffering injury, the prevention by
turning an article of clothing outside in was mentioned.
The authorities in these cases are from Harris and
from Islay. To show further the extent of this belief,
a Ross-shire man says a thing he has often seen done
for the prevention of evil influences was to turn a
child’s coat or other garment wrong side out, because:
“It is believed that a witch is rendered powerless
in respect of any person who happens at the time
when they might be injuriously affected to be wearing
any article of clothing wrong side out.”</p>

<p>Another preventative in connection with clothing
also comes from Harris. When a dress is put on for
the first time a small burning peat or burning stick is
waved over it, inside and out, and this is believed to
be an efficient protection of the wearer from an attack
by the Evil Eye. This is evidently the purification by
fire already alluded to.</p>

<p>Attracting the Evil Eye by a piece of cloth also
appears in the following from a farmer and office-bearer
in the church, a man of about seventy, but an
undoubted believer in what we may call superstitions.
Where he was brought up a rag was put in a <i lang="gd">bruchag</i>
(cranny) of the wall at the head of every milk cow in
the byre as a protection against the Evil Eye.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="TAR_AS_PREVENTATIVE">TAR AS PREVENTATIVE</h2>
</div>


<p>The application of hot pitch to open wounds in
ancient surgery is a well-known fact. It may have
acted as an antiseptic, and like its congener tar applied
for skin eruptions, may have so got into popular use as
a preventative of evil. In the island of Islay tar was
well known as an application against the Evil Eye, but
its use seems to have been restricted to Beltane night,
May Eve. One of our reciters, a man now of about
fifty, when herding cattle as a boy remembers how all
the time he was on the farm of C. at a fixed hour on
<i lang="gd">Oidhche Bhealtuinn</i> he went to the byre with the farmer
and his son. They took with them a small pot of tar
and a bit of stick, little larger than an egg-spoon. Our
reciter held the dish while the son took hold of the
ears of each of the cattle in turn and the old man put
a little tar into each ear with the stick. If any words
were spoken the boy did not hear them.</p>

<p>Another old man, a man of eighty, can neither read
nor write, without any English, adds to the putting it
in the ears that it was also put on the noses of the
cattle for the purpose of “preventing injuries from
the Evil Eye.”</p>

<p>Another, a woman of about fifty-five, says her
father was regular in the habit of putting tar on the
horns of his cows on May Eve to protect the beasts
from the Evil Eye.</p>

<p>A fourth reciter says he has often seen it put on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span>
the horns and ears, and also rowan berries tied to the
cows’ tails on the same occasion, and adds that this
was usually accompanied with the repeating of some
good words to protect the beasts from being hurt with
the Evil Eye.</p>

<p>The germicide powers of tar products seem to have
been further reaching, and even more highly appreciated
in those days than they are now.</p>

<p>The ears, we now see, played a prominent part in the
treatment of <i lang="gd">cronachadh</i>, and we learn on the authority
of a minister how that in the case of a quey supposed
to be affected by the Evil Eye, the owner loosed it
from its stall, cut a slit in its ear, repeating some
incantation the while.</p>

<p>From a man of about fifty-five, a joiner, we have
confirmation of this. He remembers of a beast dying
where he lived when he was a boy, and of seeing the
woman to whom the animal belonged and another
<i lang="gd">cailleach</i> sitting over the dead beast cutting a piece out
of its ear. They kept the piece they cut. On asking
why the women were handling the dead animal, he
was told that the piece cut from its ear would prevent
an Evil Eye affecting the rest of the cattle.</p>

</div>


<p>The detergent, and let us say with all gravity, the
cleansing power of stale urine, is well known, and it
is hardly to be wondered at when we find this used
to clear away, as it were, evil influences.</p>

<p>“There was at one time a farmer in Gruinart who
used regularly to sprinkle his cows when putting
them out with the contents of the chamber pot.
This was with the view of protecting them against
witchcraft, and I have done that myself.”</p>

<p>Our informant for this was a woman of about
sixty. This is supported by another reciter in Islay,
who said it was done in the morning.</p>

<p>Two other reciters tell that it was done in spring,
or the early part of summer, when they were put out
on the grass “for the first time that season.” The
sprinkling was done with a broom from the chamber
pot as the cattle were passing out of the byre.</p>

<p>What was good for cows was also considered good
for horses; they also got their share of attention.
Finally, in this particular, an intelligent crofter’s wife
who can read, and is of about seventy years of age,
informs us that it was customary to collect the bedroom
slops for a day or two before the birth of a child.
So soon as the child was born, to prevent any mischief
from <i lang="gd">cronachadh</i>, the house was sprinkled both outside
and in. She saw this done in her mother’s house.</p>

<p>The remark that this sprinkling was done when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span>
the cattle were first turned out, and of a statement
that it was common among farmers to have the
services of a man believed to have <i lang="gd">colas</i> to notch the
ears of cattle on May Eve against witchcraft, have to
be taken together, May Day being supposed to be a
specially active moment for the witch sisterhood.
Two reciters mention this sprinkling with “salt” and
“urine” in connection with each other. That they
were looked upon as having somewhat the same
action there can be no doubt, whatever analogy
drawn between the two may have existed in the
mind of the reciter. One of the two reciters gave
an instance which, though undoubtedly unperceived
by the narrator, throws a sidelight upon the ideas
connected with it. The mother of our reciter consulted
an <i lang="gd">eolas</i> man for the bettering of defective
churning. He gave her a bottle, directing her
to hold it in her hand all the way on her journey
home, and on no account to let it touch the ground.
When she got home she was to sprinkle some of
it on the cow and the outside of the churn, and
round about it. On her way home she rested for a
minute, and forgetting about the instructions, put
down the bottle. Sprinkling the cow did no good,
and the scientist was again consulted. <i lang="gd">“Leig thu leis
fheum a chall,” ars S.</i> (“You allowed it to lose its usefulness,”
said S.) “<i lang="gd">Rinn i gair bheag ag’radh gun do
leig i sios e car mionaid.</i>” (“She smiled, saying that she
had let it down for a minute.”) “<i lang="gd">Chaill thu e mata.</i>”
(“You have lost it, then.”) Now comes the incident
mentioned on page 119 of his retiring to the back
of the house and giving his consulter the slip of
<i lang="gd">iubhar-beinne</i> (juniper), the flavouring matter of gin,
the most diuretic of stimulants.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span></p>

<p>Putting all this together, it is not difficult to see
why part at least of the magic fluid would lose its
effect if it touched the ground, the place it most
naturally reaches, if we accept Burt’s statement, in
Highland houses, and even in a recognised house of
entertainment. “But I had like to have forgot a
Mischance that happened to me the next Morning,
for rising early, and getting out of my Box pretty
hastily, I unluckily set my Foot in the Chamber-pot,
a Hole in the Ground by the Bed-side, which was
made to serve for that Use in case of Occasion.”<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
When the next bottle reached the house and not
the ground, the effect was quite satisfactory. The
reciter of this openly professed belief in the whole
story, even to the recovery of the missing butter.</p>

<p>Many will rise up in arms against my suggestion
that the water to be used, and which was used, and
which is called water, was in many cases and in its
origin urine. In the Clonmel witch-burning case
in Ireland in 1895, Mrs. Cleary, the victim, had
“water” thrown over her, fetched by her cousin
from an adjoining room. This was brought three
or four times, and the process of sprinkling lasted
at intervals over a period of ten or twenty minutes.
This water, according to the <i>Cork Examiner</i> and
other reports, was called “a certain noxious fluid.”
According to accounts given by Leitrim people,
the most effective way of disenchanting folk was to
throw over them a concoction of strong urine and
hens’ excrement. Compare with this the Arran
man’s charm against the Evil Eye mentioned on
page 18.<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>The general protective power of stale urine is
curiously illustrated in the following from a Mackay.
The reciter said when he was young it was a general
custom throughout the Reay country to have a tub
of stale wash placed at the door cheek with a little
stick always standing in it. The stick was preferably,
if it could be got, of blackthorn—sloe. The object
of this was that visitors might stir up the contents
of the tub before going into the house, a process
intended to protect the house and its inmates from
being injured by any bad luck or misfortune, or evil
of any kind, that otherwise might accompany the
visitor. To comply with this condition was reckoned
a sufficient passport for any caller, and no matter
who he was, or on what business he had come, he
was expected to do the stirring before crossing the
threshold. The reciter said that he had done it himself
regularly in his youth.</p>

<p>The conclusion arrived at that the water supplied
in some cases, and in any case what ought to be
supplied by the practitioner of <i lang="gd">eolas</i>, was diluted
urine, seems to get important endorsation from the
following on the authority of John Kerr, LLD., late
her Majesty’s Inspector of Schools:—</p>

<p>“A man had a child suffering from water in the
head, and carried him on his back in a blanket from
Lochcarron to Lochbroom and back—over a hundred
and twenty miles—to see a man who professed to
cure such ailments. He got a bottle of water, a
spoonful of which was to be given several times a
day. The doctor found the water absolutely putrid.”<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_10" href="#FNanchor_10" class="label">[10]</a> “Memories Grave and Gay,” John Kerr, LLD., p. 323.</p>

</div>

<p>Dr. Kerr having this from a medical man, one is
inclined to fancy that the description of the dose is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span>
given in a method corresponding to an ordinary
prescription; spoonful doses remind one of the regular
practitioner. The diagnosis ‘hydrocephalus’ is the
doctor’s; the man consulted was not a curer of water
in the head, but of the results of witchcraft or the
Evil Eye. This, there can scarcely be any doubt of,
or that that also was the father’s idea of the cause of
the child’s illness—it had been <i lang="gd">air a chronachadh</i>.
Here the important point is the putridity of the
water. If it had been pure water it might have been
vapid enough, but we may be certain that no licensed
practitioner would have said that the fluid was absolutely
putrid without sufficient cause. The diagnosis
is that its putridity was occasioned by containing a
greater or less quantity of stale urine.</p>

<p>The following is vouched for by an intelligent and
educated young lady resident in Orkney, though as
it is from a non-Gaelic island it takes us to a different
people from those we have been occupied with.</p>

<p>In one of the islands there a farmer was losing his
cattle one after another. The general opinion, in
which the farmer himself concurred, was that the
fatality arose from some person’s Evil Eye having
lighted on the stock. It was also considered, as the
best means of putting an end to this, to burn one of
the remaining animals alive. This was done, and
report has it that everything went well enough after
that. This case seems sufficiently notorious, though
no more exact information has been procured; but
the Evil Eye is strongly believed in in Orkney, and
our informant herself knew a man who, on finding
things “going back” with him, as they say, confidently
attributed his unprosperity to some one
having put his Evil Eye in his effects. Many of his
neighbours, knowing the circumstances, were of the
same opinion as himself.</p>

<p>So far we seem to have seen that the damage done
by the Evil Eye was a malign dispensation of Providence,
for which the owner was only to blame to the
same extent that one is to blame for a natural defect,
but the processes of cure being the result of science,

One of the most common of the preventive charms is
something to be worn by the person to be protected,

referring to American Indians, is spoken of as a
“medicine bag,” but which the Dictionaries translate
as a charm—an incantation. A much more common
protective is the <i lang="gd">sreang a chronachaidh</i>, or <i lang="gd">snathainn
cronachaidh</i> (string or thread of hurting).</p>

<p>The form that this took differed considerably. One<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span>
reciter says it was made of different colours of yarn,
an incantation was said over it while being made,
and when finished it was tied round the child’s neck.
She has often seen these in use, and did not think
that it mattered anything what colours were used,
provided that there were different colours in it.</p>

<p>Another reciter says that the strings before being
put on were soaked in something, but does not
mention if they were coloured, while two others
mention the fact, of their personal knowledge, that
the threads they had seen worn were red.</p>

<p>In one of the last cases the thread had been put on
to cure a child supposed to be already suffering. In
the other, while the thread was used as a protection,
the reciter mentioned as a curative where something
had gone wrong with the first child of a marriage,
especially if there was any suspicion of <i lang="gd">cronachadh</i>,
that some article of clothing which had been worn
by the mother on the first night of marriage, was put
round the child three times, and “There are some,”
said he, “who take the precaution to do this as a
preventative even where no injury is suspected as
having already taken place.”</p>

<p>One of our reciters quotes the following verse of
a song as an authority for the efficacy of the red
thread:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">

  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">(“A red thread, and a knot on it,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Allan would subdue him.”)</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span></p>
<p>There can be no doubt that it is our old acquaintance
the Witch of Endor who here again appears
as Henderson.</p>

<p>The following is the account given by a man
suspected of the Evil Eye, who watched secretly
through a chink in the door the performance by a
professor of <i lang="gd">eolas</i> who was supposed to have inherited
his skill from his deceased wife. The Evil Eye doctor
went direct to the churn, which stood very much on
the middle of the floor, and walked round about it
several times, “six or seven,” says D. McF. Then
taking a ball of yarn from his pocket he wound it
round about the churn-staff, putting a good many
turns on it. This done, he gave the staff two or three
turns as hard as he could, as if churning. He then
came out, but in a short time returned, and D.,
securing his point of observation, saw him take the
yarn off the churn-staff and wind it round the churn
itself. Again he gave a few turns at churning, and
finally left. The reciter was uncertain whether or not
any benefit accrued to that churning itself.</p>

<p>The following method in the case of a lad on the
one hand, and of a cow on the other, demonstrates
pretty fully the method of using the red yarn in
Harris. The skilled woman, having assured a sick
lad that she knew what was wrong, and that it could
soon be put right, having requested all present, except
of course the patient, to leave the room, procured a
ball of <i>three-ply</i> yarn and wound it round the points
of her thumb, middle finger, and ring finger of her left
hand, holding the thread between the thumb and
mid-finger of the right hand. Having done this she
took a small piece of burning stick and passed it
three times through the circle formed by the thread<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span>
on her fingers. She then put a knot on the cord,
bringing it close to her mouth, and repeating a
lengthy incantation commencing, “<i>Ni mi an obair
so</i>” (“I do this work”), in which were references to
the “eye.” The knot having been put on and the
incantation finished she took the yarn off her finger,
and commencing at the crown of the head, she
rubbed him with it in a round and round way all
over. At this stage there was a knock at the door
to which the performer replied: “You are there, I
know you,” and without opening the door, put the
knot into the fire, saying, “<i>An galar ’s caslainnte
chuirinn air mulach an teine</i>.” (“The disease and the
illness I would put on the top of the fire.”) She
repeated this three times, and on the third occasion,
instead of putting the thread in the fire (it would
appear from this that she had made three knots, and
not one as the description would lead us to suppose)
she tied it round the lad’s neck. The thread is always
tied, said the reciter, where it will not be seen, but
it must be on the skin. Some wear such a thread
as a precaution against the Evil Eye. It was explained
that the knock at the door was done by the
individual causing the illness.</p>

<p>The following is the information as to the conduct
of the operation in the case of a cow, and our reciter
saw this herself. The <i lang="gd">eolas</i> operator first asked for
yarn in which alum had been used in the dyeing.
Our informant explained that it was necessary that
any yarn to be used should have had alum applied
to it, and as alum is always used in dyeing red (as
a mordant), red is very generally what is taken on
such occasions. Having got the little ball of red
yarn, the thread was wound round the fingers as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span>
above described, and here we learn categorically that
the forefinger must not be allowed to touch the yarn
throughout the performance. There was no burning
stick here used, but having taken the yarn off her
finger, a knot was put on the thread, the knot put to
her lips, and an incantation alluding to the eye
muttered with it in that position. This winding,
muttering, and knot-tying was gone through altogether
three times with equal care. Commencing
then with one of the horns of the animal, she rubbed
the cow down with a circular motion all over till
she came to the other horn, and then tied the first
knot on the cow’s tail, taking care to have it out of
sight, the three knots being tied one after the other
to the under hairs of the cow’s tail. When the cow
showed signs of improvement the first knot was taken
off and burned with the words used above. The
same performance being carried through with the
second knot, but the third knot was allowed to remain
on the cow’s tail. This woman refused to
impart the incantation formula to any but a member
of her own family, and it is believed that the greater
the admiration of the operator for the person affected
the more effectual the cure.</p>

<p>A native of South Uist said that while different
methods were employed to cure the Evil Eye, the
most common, so far as she could judge, was the
<i lang="gd">Snaithnean</i> (thread). This was so well known that
when the Evil Eye was suspected in the case of an
animal, <i lang="gd">faigheamaid snaithnean dhi</i> (<i lang="gd">dha</i>) (get a thread
to it), and away they would go to an <i lang="gd">eolas</i> person.
The snaithnean is simply a red woollen thread four
or five inches long. The giver of it says some
good words over it, hands it to the messenger with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span>
instructions to go straight home and tie the thread
round the animal’s tail till it recovers. In more
important cases the professor may deem it advisable
to fasten the string on himself. The reciter, though
not admitting belief in the charm as such, has seen
this done several times with good effect.</p>

<p>The above statement was thoroughly corroborated
by another from the same locality, who “has often
seen the red thread on beasts’ tails.” She spoke of
the injury as <i lang="gd">gonadh</i> (wounded).</p>

<p>An Islay woman remembers as a girl, in the case
of a cow of her mother’s, where a string was put on
the cow that was ill, but as they were all turned out
of the byre she does not know what else was done.</p>

<p>Another reciter in the same island, in the case of
one of his own horses, which was said to have been
injured by the evil eyes of drovers, had it cured by a
woollen thread being tied round its tail.</p>

<p>Before leaving the red thread, a reciter in Islay,
whose aunt lived next to a professor, said that when
this woman was consulted in cases of Evil Eye, she
took a bottle containing a red thread and water,
and for the purpose of discovering the cause of the
animals’ illness she closed her eyes and repeated an
incantation. This done she would open her eyes,
and the first living creature bearing any burden or
weight, that weight, whatever it might be, she maintained
she saw pressing upon the animal. A case
in point is the following. Having gone through her
performance when consulted about a sick cow, on
lifting up her eyes they rested on a man carrying a
horse collar. She told the owner of the cow that
the spirit of that man with the collar was pressing
on the animal, and would continue so until the water<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span>
which was in the bottle, over which she had repeated
the incantation, was sprinkled on her. If after that
the cow shivered all over she would not get better,
but if she merely shook her ears she would be all
right. The people about, the reciter added, had
great confidence in this woman’s professions.</p>

<p>Another reciter said that when a child was not
thriving a red thread was tied round its neck and
allowed to remain on night and day. He has seen
this where he knew both the child and its parents
very intimately.</p>

<p>It must not, however, be supposed that red thread
alone was used. Another Argyllshire reciter has
seen on Hallowe’en different colours of worsted
thread tied on cattle as a prophylactic.</p>

<p>The mother of the child, in which the symptom
of injury by the Evil Eye was its seeming to sing
“do re do,” gives the following account of the
thread tied on it which cured it. His father went
to an <i lang="gd">eolas</i> woman and told her his business. She
took some lint that she had ready to be put on the
spindle and twisted a little bit into a thread. It must
always be green lint that is used for these threads. She
made a string that would go three times round his neck,
and getting the man’s knife she wound the thread round
the steel, and handing it to him ordered him to hold
it in his hand all the way home, and not to open his
hand or speak to anybody till he would reach home.
He was then to put the string three times round
the child’s neck, and as he was getting better one
string at a time was to be taken off and thrown
into the fire. This was all done as directed, the
“humming” stopped, and the child got quite well.</p>

<p>A native of Strontian gave the following as his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span>
own experience of the use of a green thread. When
a boy he had a “fallen” uvula, and was sent to a
woman who was said to be able to “lift” it. She
took him into a corner of the house and commenced
manipulating the outside of his throat and below
his chin, speaking all the time as if to herself. At
all events he could not follow what she said, though
he heard the words <i lang="gd">Sheumais, Eoin, ‘s Pheadair</i>
(James’, John’s, and Peter’s) frequently. Having done
this some time, she tied a green thread about his
neck and sent him away, saying it would be all
right. Mr. McD. added the remark that he had
nothing to give the operator, though it is essential
that something pass from your hand into theirs. A
reason for this was given by a native of Fort William,
that “unless the curer got something for putting
the trouble away the trouble would go on him- (her)
self.”</p>

<p>A curer of cases of Evil Eye in the neighbourhood
of Ballachulish, though her method of treatment was
not wholly known to the reciter, part of it consisted
in giving water and two threads (three articles), one
black and one white. The threads were to be twisted
in a prescribed manner round the person or animal
affected, and if the threads showed any tendency to
knot, it was taken as a sure sign that it was a case
of the Evil Eye, <i>i.e.</i> apparently if they formed <i>eyes</i>
on the thread.</p>

<p>Ligatures other than thread were used. A native
of Easdale tells how his grandaunt used to tell him
of a relative who lived with her father. He was a
farmer, and losing his cattle, and believing that they
were being affected by the Evil Eye, took his courage
in both hands and marched off to consult Campbell<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span>
of Skipness, distinguished for his skill in such cases.
Having told his errand, Campbell took him into the
barn and, excluding all light, made the people—that
is, the Evil Eye people—pass before him, and he
recognised them quite well. Campbell then gave
him a <i lang="gd">gisreag</i> (charm) made of a straw rope, and
requested him to take it home with him and throw
it into the fire as soon as he reached his destination.
This was to protect him against further injury. The
man burned the <i lang="gd">gisreag</i> on reaching home, and from
that day his cattle throve quite well.</p>

<p>Another reciter remembers that her brother having
gone to consult a professor of <i lang="gd">eolas</i> on account of
serious losses to his stock, while he was away a new
horse, bought to take the place of one that had died,
was taken ill between the plough chains. Well does
she remember, on her brother’s return, seeing him
take the tether with which it had been tied, and
waving it three times over the horse, it got up at
once, took the food offered it, and was soon all
right.</p>

<p>From Tomintoul, Banffshire, we hear of one who
had a wide reputation for skill in these matters, who
was said to perform his charms by means of a bridle
that was in his possession. We have no further
particulars, but it is not impossible that the bridle was
a rope one.</p>

<p>There has been mentioned the case of a young
horse where the result of the Evil Eye was to make it
pour of sweat and tremble. Having got it back into
the stable, a recognised practitioner of <i lang="gd">eolas</i> was sent
for. Among his questions was one whether the lad
who was leading it had, or had not, met any one on
the road. He then asked for the halter which had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span>
been on the horse, and it having been brought him he
said one or two words which nobody present seemed
able to catch, after which, waving the halter three times
over the animal, he said, “Rise and eat.” At once the
horse got on its feet, began to eat, and was cured.
McA., the <i lang="gd">eolas</i> man, now said it was a case of
<i lang="gd">cronachadh</i>, and offered to tell who had done it. They
assured him they did not wish to know. But the
reciter made the naïve remark that “he knew already,
for he knew who had met him on the road.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="UISGE_A_CHRONACHAIDH_WATER">UISGE A’ CHRONACHAIDH (WATER
OF INJURY)</h2>
</div>


<p>We have already mentioned, as one of the results of
the Evil Eye, a bad attack of yawning. Here is the
account of the sufferer’s cure in the words of the
reciter. “<i lang="gd">Chuir iad airson sean-mhathair Sheumais
Ruaidh so agus nur a thainig ise rinn i eolas le beagan
uisge agus facailean, agus cha robh a chaileag tiota an deigh
sin gus an robh i cho mhath ’s bha i riamh. Dh’innis
a bhean a leighis i ra mathair gur h-ann air a cronachadh
a bha i.</i>” (“They sent for this Red James’ grandmother,
and when she came she made science with a little
water and words, and it was but a short time till the
girl was as well as ever she was. The woman that
cured her told her mother that she had been injured
by <i lang="gd">cronachadh</i>.”)</p>

<p>The water used here was what has been called in
Arran at any rate “<i lang="gd">uisge a’ chronachaidh.</i>”</p>

<p>One other account of this Evil Eye water we will
give in the words of the reciter, an old man speaking
of his daughter:“ <i lang="gd">‘Nuair a bha ’m bas ag’oibrich rithe
thainig i dhachaidh an so agus bha e soilleir gum b’ann
air a cronachadh a bha i. Nis chuala mi fhein daoine ag
radh nam biodh neach air a chronachadh agus nam biodh
bonn airgeid air a chuir ann am bowl uisge a bhiodh air a
thoirt a tobar o’n taobh deas, nan leanadh an t-airgiod ri
grunnd a’ bhowl, nuair a dhoirte an t-uisge dheth, gun
cuireadh an t-uisge sin an cronachadh air falbh nam<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span>
biodh e air a chrathadh air a’ neach a bha fo’n chronachadh.
Well, chaidh mi fhein gu tobar a bha ris an taobh
deas de’n tigh agam agus chuir mi bonn se sgillinn an an
lan bowl-de’n uisge ach nuair a thaomadh an t-uisge dheth,
cha do lean am bonn ris a bhowl. Ach co dhiu chrath mi
’n t-uisge oirre ach ged a chrath cha d’rinn e feum sam bi,
’s cha deachaidh i riomh ni b’fhearr. Ach bha daoine ag
radh nan robh an t-airgiod air leantuinn ris a’ bhowl gun
deannadh an t-uisge an cronachadh a thoirt air falbh.</i>”
(“When death was working with her she came home
here, and it was clear that she had been blighted. I
myself heard people saying if any one were blighted
and a coin put into a bowl of water, which would be
taken from a southern well, if the money stuck to the
bottom of the bowl when the water was poured off it,
that that water would put away the injury if it were
sprinkled on the person harmed. Well, I went myself
to a well that was on the south side of my house, and
I put a sixpenny piece in a bowlful of the water, but
when the water was poured off the piece did not stick
to the bowl; but however, I sprinkled the water on
her, but though I did sprinkle it it was of no use
whatever, and she never got any better. But people
were saying, had the money stuck to the bowl the
water would have caused the blight to be removed.”)</p>

<p>The methods of preparation of this water undoubtedly
vary, not merely because the reciters do
not give the particulars, but because the operators
make differences. A messenger being sent to a woman
for <i lang="gd">eolas</i>, we are told “she gave the one that went a
bottle of water with directions that it was to be thrown
on the cow.”</p>

<p>Another reciter said that a woman being brought
to see a sick cow (D. MacC.’s grandmother), “when she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span>
came she took a cog with water and went in to where
the cow was. She was a decent woman, and whatever
she did to the cow she got better.”</p>

<p>In another case the local practitioner, when sent
for, walked round the cow three times, and our
reciter said, she may have done something more,
but in any case she failed to do any good, and
the cow continued ill. They then sent a messenger to
another woman of the same sort, but of greater repute,
and who lived at a greater distance. This woman
gave the messenger a bottle of something like water,
with instructions that it was to be sprinkled over the
cow. When the messenger returned home and the
stuff in the bottle was sprinkled on the cow, she got
up, shook herself, began to show signs of recovery,
and in a short time was all right.</p>

<p>In another case the woman sent for, “when she
came said it was a case of injury by <i lang="gd">cronachadh</i>,
and having repeated some words over the cow, she
sprinkled water she had prepared upon her with the
result that the cow soon got well.”</p>

<p>A male professor made up a bottle for a shepherd
whose cow was ill, and instructed him on reaching
home to sprinkle “all that was in the bottle” on
certain parts of the cow. It is not advisable to take
too literally statements which apparently are very
exact; “all the water” in this case may simply mean
the water that was in the bottle more or less in its
totality. Or it may have been the instruction was so
worded that if some of the water, even a drop or two,
might be supposed not to have got on the cow that
the charm would be ineffective. The destination of
the water for particular parts of the animal was undoubtedly
a usual proviso.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span></p>

<p>So far the information might lead one to suppose
that an incantation said over water was sufficient in
the beliefs of the operators. This is however not
the case, and there can be little doubt that to make
the incantation effective the water should have been
in contact with silver. A native of Harris said that
he has heard of the “water of silver” as a cure for
people and beasts affected by the Evil Eye, and also
as a preventative of such injury if apprehended. In
one instance which came under his own observation,
a respectable and intelligent woman, to protect her cow
and the milk and butter, first time she went to milk the
cow after calving, put a half-crown piece in the bottom
of the pail and drew the milk on to it. A friend who
accompanied her saw the whole performance.</p>

<p>A native of Islay informed us that for curing
eyes of those suffering from <i lang="gd">cronachadh</i> you should
put “three bawbees in the water”; while a native
of Oban says that in all cases of <i lang="gd">cronachadh</i> where
water is used as a cure it must be poured on silver.</p>

<p>A clergyman living in Skye recently heard of a
case in the parish of Kildonan where water in
which silver had been immersed was sprinkled upon
a cow which was unwell. The further information
in this case was that the woman in the district
specially referred to was exceedingly superstitious,
and expressed her belief that she would become a
bird after death. She always repeated a rhyme when
operating upon cattle. She had died shortly before
our reciter went to Skye.</p>

<p>A school teacher, a native of Skye and carrying
on her occupation in Argyllshire, confirms the strong
belief in the Evil Eye in certain places. A few years
ago in D—— a young woman was driving her cow<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</span>
to pasture when the cow fell. Her owner turned
towards a neighbour’s daughter who had been looking
at them passing and scolded her for the accident,
finishing by stating that the onlooker was “mad.”
The retort was that that affliction was hereditary
with the cow’s owner. The interchange of compliments
got the credit of curing the cow, which
arose and went its way. The cure, according to
this reciter, for any sudden sickness in cattle was to
take a threepenny bit, or any small silver, and ask
a blessing on it in the name of the Father, place it
in a basin, pour water on it, and dash over the cow
in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.</p>

<p>In the following case the operation, though carried
out by Gaelic-speaking Highlanders, was conducted
in the Lowlands. A child was supposed to be the
victim of <i lang="gd">cronachadh</i>, and the operator was the
daughter of a woman who had practised <i lang="gd">eolas</i>. A
fellow-servant of the operator was the reciter.
“Water was procured from a running stream, it
being necessary that the person bringing the water
should have a piece of bread of some sort in his
possession at the time. A silver coin was put in the
dish in which the water was, and the operator waved
the dish in a particular manner and then sprinkled
some of the water on the child. The remainder
was then dashed against a large stone. Stress was
laid on the necessity of this part of the performance,
it being essential that the stone was immovable. A
solid wall, for instance the gable of a house, was
said to be equally efficient.<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_12" href="#FNanchor_12" class="label">[12]</a> If, as the writer believes, the original fluid was that mentioned in
1 Kings xiv. 10, xvi. 11, the deduction is that it should be that of a
male, not a female.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span></p>

<p>Brought up in a Presbyterian community, the
writer has little knowledge of the manœuvres of traditional
Episcopacy or Romanism, but while speaking
of this a friend, whose niece was being baptized
in a hurry, gives the following information. Though
the child was supposed to be dying, the officiating
clergyman had first to array himself in his official
costume, and then, producing a small alabaster font,
prepared the water of baptism in that. Having performed
the ceremony, he turned to the infant’s aunt
and requested to be taken to the garden, to which
he himself carried the water and emptied it on the
ground. Our informant, herself a Presbyterian, was
speaking of the matter afterwards to the certificated
nurse. She said the performance was not new to
her, and told how in a like case the clergyman, not
being provided with his own font, and asking for a
basin, was given a nice Sèvres bowl. After the
ceremony he also proceeded outside, and not only
emptied out the water, but deliberately smashed the
basin to prevent its subsequent use for any other
purpose.</p>

<p>A variation in the ceremony occurred in the
following case, the operator being a Lewis man. He
had a nice foal which had been a good deal admired,
and he was desirous of protecting it from the Evil
Eye. Putting a silver coin in a dish he poured water
on it. He then poured off about half of the water,
apparently making a libation, and the other half he
sprinkled over the foal. After this treatment he
considered it would be difficult for any Evil Eye
to injure it.</p>

<p>A native of Bernera, Harris, who can neither read
nor write and has no English, shortens the process.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span>
“<i lang="gd">Tha rathad eile anns an gabh cronachadh bhi air a chuir

can be cured. If one takes a piece of silver in his
hand and pours water on the silver and then rubs
his wet hand on the child’s face. That would
do it.”)</p>

<p>In tracing the accounts we have received of this
Evil Eye water we started with those which seemed
to deal with plain water, then with water in which one
coin, and that necessarily of silver, had been placed,
and now we will consider those cases where more
than one coin has been used. The number seems
always to be, in this case, limited to three. A native
of Sutherlandshire, now resident in the mainland of
Argyle, remembers as a boy accompanying an old
woman to a certain well near his native place for
water to be used to cure a sick child, believed to have
been <i lang="gd">air a chronachadh</i>. The woman had a tin can
with her into which she put a sixpence, a threepenny
bit, and other coins, said our informant, all silver. Before
setting out he was warned that he must not speak
a word, but forgetting himself he began to talk. The
woman instantly stopped him, insisting that he must
return home at once if he uttered another word. He
kept silence after that, and when they returned with
the water the woman whom he had accompanied
sprinkled it on the sick child.</p>

<p>A native of Lochaber gives the following as the
result of his own observation there. He saw different
coins used, but understood that, at any rate, there
should be silver. The description was given in connection<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</span>
with the use of the water as a diagnostic of
<i lang="gd">cronachadh</i>, and was as follows: The coins were put
into an empty dish—a wooden one—and the water
poured upon them was well water, preferably from a
spring. The operator then tilted the dish over and
observed whether the coin adhered to the bottom or
fell away. The reciter disclaimed accurate knowledge,
but said he believed if the coins adhered it was an
indication of <i lang="gd">cronachadh</i>, but if they fell away the illness
was from some “natural” cause.</p>

<p>A diagnostic point with this coin water, over which
however an incantation had been repeated, the words
of which had not been understood by the bystanders,
was made by a male practitioner of <i lang="gd">eolas</i> who, sprinkling
the water on some sick cows they immediately
began to bellow, said that beyond doubt they had
been afflicted by “witchcraft.” He inquired if any
milk from the cows had been supplied to others not
on the farm, and when told the name of a woman so
supplied, at once said that it was she who had done
the mischief. Again repeating a word formula,
whether the same or not, the reciter did not know,
he sprinkled the rest of the water on the cows, and
thereafter their milk was believed to have been quite
normal.</p>

<p>A native of Morven giving her account of the
practice there, and being a firm believer in the Evil
Eye, said that the water had to be taken from a well
facing the south, and the silver coin being in it, the
water had to be poured into a bottle from the original
dish, and the sticking of the coin to the bottom was a
sign of the probable recovery of the animal for whom
the water was intended.</p>

<p>Above it was said that three coins seemed to be the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span>
essential number when more than one was used, and
we give here on the authority of a clergyman, his
report of information derived from the late Mr.
Stewart, the minister of Nether Lochaber. When a
person is out of sorts and all overish, as they say, he
is considered a proper subject for the silver water
cure. A female well advanced in life is usually the
operator, and she produces from her store a silver
coin, the larger the coin the better, a crown piece for
choice, but if it is to be had, a silver brooch with
silver interlacements is even better. Getting a wooden
bicker, or earthenware bowl, she goes to the nearest
running water and fills her vessel from the stream
to the depth that when she dips her middle finger
straight down in it the water will be as high as the
second joint of the finger. Having got the water she
drops the coin or brooch into it, and then makes as
straight a course as she can towards the place where
the one is upon whom the charm is to be wrought.
She must take great care that she does not spill a
drop of the water by the way, and this being accomplished,
the straighter the course followed the greater
the omen of success. The one to be cured is now
made to lie on his back—chest and neck bare—while
the woman stands over him with the bowl of silver
water in her left hand. Having dipped the forefinger
of her right hand in the water, she makes the sign of
the cross upon his forehead and in a low voice
repeats an incantation. During the incantation, with
her right hand she sprinkles the water on the patient
seven times and as rapidly as possible. There is then
only enough water left to cover the coins; this the
patient is made to drink till the last drop, the bowl
being tilted over till the coin touches his lips. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</span>
patient being now assured that he has been cured, is
made to rise and resume his usual occupations. The
words of the incantation as translated are:—</p>

<p>“Trinity, and might, and mercy, Holy and most
merciful to human suffering and sorrow: Ever
Blessed Father, loving Son of Mary, and Oh kindly
Spirit of health and healing. Expel the demon of
despondency and fear out of this Thy servant who
believeth in Thy word.</p>

<p>“Holy Apostles, twelve, and Mary mother, and
meek Saint Bridget, and Saint Columba too, exquisite
singer of holy hymns, good and wise, intercede for
him with intercession of efficacy and power. Let
relief come now, and health and peace.</p>

<p>“Let the evil that afflicted him be driven by
the winds afar: And let him arise in strength and
hope and joy, to magnify the goodness of the
most High.</p>

<p>“With water of silver, from swiftly running
stream I sprinkle Thee. Arise and be well.”</p>

<p>Unfortunately our informant was unable to give
us the Gaelic words. The ceremonies here, probably
having been performed in Lochaber where the
Romish faith is still strong, point them back to
Roman influences. There is an accuracy of description
and attention to detail suggestive of the literary
man very rarely to be got from popular reciters. We
have however quoted our authority, one well known
throughout the Highlands.</p>

<p>In the above there is no question of prognosticating,
and the choice of the heaviest silver coin or of a
silver brooch, which might be the size of a saucer,
militates entirely against the chance of its sticking,
even to the bottom of a wooden vessel. We are able<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</span>
to give a quite unembellished account of the same
process from the same district by a native. “I mind
one time the best cow I ever had was <i lang="gd">air a’ cronachadh</i>.
I went for an old woman I knew who could
cure beasts. She was a decent woman, and when
she came she had water with her in a dish she had
brought. She put a shilling in the dish, and then
poured the water into another dish and turned that
in which it had been upside down, but the shilling
stuck to the bottom and did not fall. She struck
the dish on the bottom three times with her hand,
but still the shilling held on, and I had to pull it
away with my fingers. The woman said that was
clear enough proof that the cow had been injured
by somebody’s ‘eye,’ and she went on to heal her.
She put the water on the cow’s head and horns,
sprinkled some all over it, and put some down its
throat. In a short time the cow was all right.”
Compare it with the following account by a native of
the parish of Urray, in Rosshire, who has seen this
“silver cure” as she calls it applied both to people and
beasts. She explained that it did not need a professional
to do it, any one can do it for another. Here,
then, we see that the virtue lies in the silver itself
apparently. “Water must be taken in the name of
the Trinity from where the living and the dead pass.
When the water is brought home, silver, gold, and
copper are put in a dish and the water poured on
their top. Usually coins are used, but a gold ring or
earring will do as well. The person or beast that is
to be healed should be made to drink a mouthful or
two of the water, and should be sprinkled all over with
the rest of it. That is all that is needed for the cure.
When one desires to find out if it is a case of hurt by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</span>
the Evil Eye, the dish in which the water and the
coins were is carefully turned over till it is mouth
downwards. If the coins left in it stick to the bottom
it is a sign that it was the Evil Eye that caused
the trouble; if they fall away the trouble was a
natural one.</p>

<p>Here we see a distinct reference to the Trinity,
and we also notice that if we were to take that
reciter’s account of it all the three representatives,
apparently, in order to settle the diagnosis would
require to stick to the bottom of the dish.</p>

<p>But another reciter from the same county, but
from the parish of Tarbert, makes it clear that if the
silver sticks the question is settled. When the
reciter’s son was a baby she was living with her
aunt, and one day the child began to scream as if
in great pain. Nothing tried seemed to give relief,
and her aunt, suspecting Evil Eye, took the reciter’s
marriage ring, a sixpence, and a penny, and putting
them into a dish, poured water on them and then
poured the water slowly off into another dish. She
then turned the dish upside down. The ring and
the penny came out, but the sixpence stuck, and
although the bottom of the dish was struck with her
hand outside, the coin still remained. This confirmed
her aunt’s suspicion. She said, “See you that?
The child was hurt by some one envying it.” The
reciter added, “He was a very pretty child at any
rate.” The aunt gave the baby (some of?) the water
to drink, and he soon got better.</p>

<p>A man and his wife, natives of Kinlochbervie in
Sutherlandshire, separately interviewed, agree as to
the common belief there in the Evil Eye and <i lang="gd">cronachadh</i>
generally. Mr. G. himself when a boy, being<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</span>
taken ill somewhat suddenly, his mother, suspecting
that he had been <i lang="gd">air a chronachadh</i>, got water, into
which she put a gold, a silver, and a copper coin, and
sprinkled the water on his face.</p>

<p>Mrs. H. said she has often seen it done both to
cattle and people, and that it was, as well as a cure,
a preventative where no suspicion of evil had already
occurred, but only when it was dreaded, as, for
example, in the case of young persons of prepossessing
appearance.</p>

<p>From Back in Lewis we have evidence to the
same effect, the belief in the Evil Eye being very
common, and the cure by sprinkling water off the
three metals usually resorted to. The reciter had
seen it frequently done in the case of animals, on one
occasion to a child. Application was here made to
an <i lang="gd">eolas</i> woman. She had water for the purpose
brought from under where the living and the dead
pass, put the three coins in a dish, poured the water
on the metal, and sprinkled the child with the
water.</p>

<p>The belief in the Evil Eye no doubt is pagan,
though believed to be supported by Christian dogma,
and seeing the importance attached to the rite of
baptism in the name of the Trinity, it seems hardly
to be wondered at that some equivalent ceremony
should have been evolved for the cure of so mystic
an influence as the Evil Eye. The writer would,
he believes, be the last person to insinuate anything
derogatory to one Church more than another; but
using all honest material, the following statement
must not be passed over.</p>

<p>A native of the north of Ireland, admitting the
common belief in his own district in the Evil Eye,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</span>
there called, as we have already stated, “blinked,”
informs us that the services of the priests are in
demand in such cases, and it is currently reported
that priests do give bottles of fluid to be sprinkled
on the animals affected, with what is believed to
be satisfactory result. He added that there was a
story told of a man damaging his cow by using
another bottle containing vitriol instead of that given
by the priest. If such a thing did happen it was
the man’s fault, and in no way affects the question
under discussion.</p>

<p>In reciting their incantations the practitioners
also vary. The performance, as described by an
eye-witness, in one case was that the woman consulted
put something in a bottle, put the bottle to
her mouth, spoke something into it, and then threw
what was in the bottle over the cow to be cured.
The result in this case was quite satisfactory, almost
immediate.</p>

<p>In an Islay instance the woman consulted “went
down to the little river that was below the houses.
She had a wee dish with her, and she went on her
knees and said some of the good words that she had
while she was lifting the water. She took the water
to where the mare was and said more of the words,
and sprinkled the water over the mare.” The result
in this case was that the mare got better, but was
never so sound as she had been before, and once
she got out of the stable she never could be either
forced or coaxed to enter it again, do what they
would, and the attempt was frequently made.</p>

<p>It seems possible that the account given by one
reciter of the preparation of <i lang="gd">uisge a chronachaidh</i>, in
which he stated that the performer takes the water<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</span>
to be used into his or her mouth, and from the mouth
puts it into a bottle to be sprinkled from the bottle
upon the person or beast to be cured, may have
been a conclusion formed from the incantation
process being carried on over the mouth of the
bottle.</p>

<p>The following account, however, by a Mull woman
of her own experience shows that spitting into the
healing water has actually been practised. The
reciter’s aunt, suspecting that a cow which she had
was suffering from <i lang="gd">cronachadh</i>, sent her to the <i lang="gd">eolas</i>
woman to tell her about the beast. She found the
professor in bed ill, but after giving her message
the woman sent her for water to be taken from
under a bridge in the neighbourhood. The living
and the dead pass over this bridge, and it was
always from this place that healing water for <i lang="gd">cronachadh</i>
was taken. While repeating the incantation
she would now and again spit into the bottle, which
she gave our reciter to take to her aunt. The
water was sprinkled over the animal, which recovered.</p>

<p>Before considering water as a curative which had
been in contact with other things than coin, the
importance attached to silver will be made more
clear by the belief put in practice that a silver coin
in the pail at milking time will prevent any one
taking the butter away by witchcraft. This was
first noticed by a native of Ayrshire, and is practised
in Islay also.</p>

<p>An Islay farmer and his wife being from home,
the niece in charge during their absence found the
churning had gone wrong. It was suggested to her
to put a silver coin under the churn to counteract<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</span>
the action of any Evil Eye. What the result was
in that case could not be found out; but recently a
cow having calved, to prevent any ill effect from
the Evil Eye, a silver coin was put in her first milk,
which was given to the cow herself to swallow, as
soon as drawn from her.</p>

<p>Throughout the country at large the water prepared
upon coin is undoubtedly generally known as “silver
water,” though we have shown that gold as well as
copper—but gold more frequently—is associated
with the silver. It is interesting to notice that in
one account from Sutherlandshire the silver cure is
described as being done with “a gold ring, and a
silver coin put in a dish of water. The best dish is
a wooden one with wooden hoops and no nails or
iron of any kind about it.” The silver coin should
be “a shilling for a man, but if it is for a woman a
sixpence will do.”</p>

<p>From West Ross-shire, and from it alone, has information
reached us of the use of the title “gold cure.”
Our informant says, “I went to see a child that was
unwell, and its mother told me that she believed that
it had been hurt by the Evil Eye. She said she
was going to try the ‘gold cure’ for it, but she
had no gold of any description in the house, and she
asked me if I had any about me that I could lend
her for the purpose. I had none at the time, so I
could not oblige her, but inquired of her how it was
to be used. She said she would put it in a dish of
water and wash the child with the water.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="STONES_AND_WATER">STONES AND WATER</h2>
</div>


<p>Above it was indicated that the water was put in
contact with other things besides coins. In the case
of the Mull woman already quoted, who had to use
her butter from its unpleasant appearance for wool-greasing
and such like, the <i lang="gd">eolas</i> man whom she
consulted put things right by getting water “and
some kind of stones from a particular burn which
he put in the water. It was necessary,” said the
reciter, “that the stones should be taken from a
particular burn.” She was unable to state what
were the peculiar conditions which made that burn
essential. The collector, who got this information
in speaking to another woman in Tobermory and
who believed that <i lang="gd">cronachadh</i> was quite common,
remembering the previous case, and hoping to draw
information, suggested that certain stones were used
for curing in Evil Eye cases. “Yes,” said the reciter,
“but there is nothing so good as three pieces of
silver, three silver coins of any kind. If the water
is poured on three silver coins, and the words said
over either beast or body, it will cure them.”</p>

<p>The following is a fairly circumstantial account
from the parish of Clyne, Sutherlandshire, of the performance
with stones and silver of a strong believer.
She had a delicate daughter, and believed if people,
especially strangers, looked at the girl she was sure
to be ill after it, and often she would be so bad<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</span>
that she had to go to bed. The mother then tried
the following cure, believed by many to be successful.
She took a basin and put a silver coin into it,
and went to a running stream near her house. From
the bottom of the stream she chose seven small
stones, which she put in the basin along with the
coin, then dipping the basin in the stream so that
the water ran into it on the top of the silver and
the stones till slightly more than half full. She then
went home, gave her daughter a little of the water
to drink, and sprinkled a little of it on her. She
kept the remainder beside her, and whenever there
was any suspicion that an Evil Eye had again fallen
upon her, the same process was carried out. Unfortunately
the cure failed, the girl having died. It
is more than probable that the weakly girl, imbued
with her mother’s superstition, suffered when looked
at by strangers, or when she thought she was regarded
with curiosity; if she had merely been nervous she
would probably have been cured.</p>

<p>A native of Jura told how, when living with her
sister there, one of the children becoming unwell
an <i lang="gd">eolas</i> woman was sent for, who got some stones,
a darning needle, water, and other things, and with
these did something to the child, but it did not recover.
Our informant said they were strong in the
belief that the child had been <i lang="gd">air a cronachadh</i>.</p>

<p>Another account of the use of the darning needle
comes from Ardrishaig. Our informant’s grandmother
had a cow grazing at the roadside, and a
woman, suspected of having an Evil Eye, passing,
said, “<i lang="gd">S mart bhriagh thu, ge bi leis thu</i>” (“You are
a bonnie cow, to whomsoever you belong”). Shortly
after the cow was found “lying rolled up in a lump.”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</span>
“My grandmother went with a luggie for water and
put a darning needle, silver, and copper into the
water. She then poured some of the water down
the cow’s throat, rubbed her horns with the water,
and sprinkled the rest all over her. In a little the
cow was all right.”</p>

<p>The same reciter mentioned another case, in which
the operator was her mother. A calf became ill, and
the owners were in doubts what to do with it. “My
mother, remembering my grandfather’s cow, put spring
water in a luggie (it must be spring water) and a
silver and a copper coin and a darning needle. She
forced some of the water down the calf’s throat, and
sprinkled the rest over it. The calf recovered, and
the farmer’s wife was so pleased and said to my
mother, ‘Well, well, Mrs. S., I never saw the like of
you, you can do anything.’”</p>

<p>No detailed description was given of the stones
used, but as <i lang="gd">clach-na-sùil</i>, the stone (apple) of the
eye, is common Gaelic, they were doubtless of a
sort more or less representative of eyes.</p>

<p>From Kintyre, the following information in the
words of the reciter gives us some indication. “They
used tae hae a bunch o’ sea-shore stanes wi’ holes
in them hanging up at the door tae keep awa‘
witches.” The collector had seen such stones in a
house in Kintyre, but at the time did not know their
purpose. They were of the honeycombed sort that
may be found on shores where there are quantities
of shingle. There were six or seven tied on a string
hung above the inside of the inner door; they were
of different sizes, guessed at from fourteen to sixteen
ounces in weight.</p>

<p>From the island of Lewis we have another indication.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</span>
There, there is a considerable amount of
superstition connected with what is called <i lang="gd">a’ chlach
nathrach</i> (the serpent’s stone). The reciter, who had
seen several of them, said they were usually round
with one hole through them, though there may be
two in some cases. The popular account of the
information given was as follows: A number of
serpents congregating at certain times form themselves
into a knot and move round and round on
the stone until a hole is worn. They then pass
and repass after each other through the hole, leaving
a coating of slime round the hole, which by-and-by
becomes hard. It is this slime that gives to the
stone the healing properties it is supposed to possess.
The principal use of the stone was as a cure for
the Evil Eye. Water is poured on the stone, and
the person or beast affected is caused to drink the
water, or has it sprinkled on them; sometimes the
application is both external and internal. These
stones are much prized by their possessors, who are
very unwilling to part with them, and would not
even willingly show them, or even acknowledge that
they possessed them.</p>

<p>Stories of the knot of serpents being seen are still
told. A very old man, a labourer, without English,
and who can neither read nor write, gives the following
account:—</p>

<p>“All the serpents in the country round about
gather together to one place on one day every year,
where they have a day’s play. The play consists in
rolling in a lump on a stone and running through
a hole on the stone one after another. One time
Georsa Cailean’s wife (the wife of George, the son
of Colin) was going home to her father, and when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</span>
she was just beside a beautiful green spot near <i lang="gd">Beinn
Tartbheil</i> (Islay), she noticed that it was covered with
serpents as thick as they could lie on the top of one
another. They had gathered there that year for
their play. She got a fright and ran, but if she had
gone among them she would have got the serpent’s
stone.”</p>

<p>A strong endeavour was made to acquire one of
these stones, said to have been found in a serpent’s
den, but negotiations came to nothing, as the owners
believing that it was good as a cure, especially for
serpents’ bite, refused to part with it.</p>

<p>It is not necessary here to discuss St. Fillan, but
it is a well-known fact that the three stones, supposed
to have been in his possession and kept in the meal
mill at Killin, were supposed to impart healing efficacy
to water in which they were steeped, and which recently,
at any rate, was given to diseased cattle as a
curative.</p>

<p>The stones principally used then are stones with
an eye or eyes in them—compare usual description
of the hole in the top of a needle, the eye of the
needle. The stones of St. Fillan seem the nearest
symbolical equivalent we have to the protruded fingers
of southern Europe, which again is nearly identical
with the one-eyed Fachan—the <i lang="gd">Direach glinn Eiti</i>
(Straight of the downy glen?) of I. F. Campbell,<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> and
with which we may connect the protruded forefinger
which was not to touch the yarn, mentioned on
page 145.</p>

<p>An Islay woman tells the following of her mother.
“She was telling me how one time the butter went
away from their milk, and for a good while they
could not get a bit of butter. She was advised to
go to that woman, and she went. When she told her
that she could get no butter the woman took an iron
and put it into the fire until it was red-hot; she then
took it out and put it into a stoup of water, repeating
some words at the same time. Some of this water
was given to my mother to put into the churn, and
would you believe it, the butter came back, and not
only that, but with the very first churning there was
a great quantity, equal to all that had been lost since
things had gone wrong.”</p>

<p>The reciter was a woman of about five-and-thirty,
now a small farmer’s wife, and well educated for her
station.</p>

<p>The iron in this case was heated, but in another
instance, in which a horse belonging to the reciter’s
grandfather was supposed to be injured by the Evil
Eye, the <i lang="gd">eolas</i> professor, a woman, having got water,
dipped a bunch of keys into it and then hung the
keys round the horse’s neck, and sprinkled the water
over the animal, repeating words which the reciter
could not catch. The horse got well.</p>

<p>That for the cold iron, and now for the heat.

churning, he would take a live ember from the fire
and put it in a dish of water, and that would preserve
the produce.”)</p>

<p>As a mere suggestion, a guess for what it is
worth, knowing that the old process of preparing
hot water by immersing heated stones in it was
practised by Highlanders, we here may have the
ordinary method of scalding the churn and dishes,
at one time common, become a superstitious formula.</p>

<p>The power of iron as protective against witchcraft,
fairies, and all supernatural powers is too widespread
to need special consideration. We must not however
always conclude that when what is used as a means
of cure is composed of iron that the iron is the
principal matter. A reciter near Campbeltown gave
the following information:—</p>

<p>“Mattie Lavarty used to be going about the
country here makin’ <i lang="gd">eolas</i>. I mind yince a coo belongin‘
tae yin Neil R. took ill before calfing, an’ they
sent for Mattie Lavarty. She worked aboot the coo
wi’ water, an’ said her paternoster or somethin’ else
o’er’t an left a horseshoe in front o’t. But the next
mornin’ whan Neil gaed intae the byre the calf
was lyin’ deed in the greep (byre gutter). That pit
Neil frae gaun near Mattie or the like o’ her ever
after.”</p>

<p>Our business here is not with Mattie’s success or
failure, but with the subject matter used in her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</span>
attempted cure. The illness of the cow was probably
a protracted labour, and Mattie put before it
what was symbolical of a free passage for the expected
calf. It was no mere placing of something
for luck, but a use of the symbol of reproduction
on an appropriate occasion.</p>

</div>


<p>The reciter in this case was a native of Tarbert,
Kintyre. Believing his cow to be suffering from the
Evil Eye, he sent for a practitioner of <i lang="gd">eolas</i>. When
she arrived, the first thing she did was to procure
various kinds of wood and “different kinds of water.”
She made circles with a stick, repeating “words”
the while. This done, she requested the owner to
go out of the byre, she remaining alone in it for a
considerable time. She put the water in which the
wood had been steeped on the cow. The animal
recovered.</p>

<p>It seems reasonable to conclude that the <i lang="gd">iubhar
beinne</i> (the juniper) would be one of the woods used,
but no exact information was obtainable. (See page<a href="#Page_119"> 119</a>)</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="SALT_AS_CURE_AND_PREVENTATIVE">SALT AS CURE AND PREVENTATIVE</h2>
</div>


<p>Salt is employed as a cure and preventative. The
following experience of a Kintyre farmer’s wife,
recited by herself, gives considerable detail of the
process carried out. “I mind yin o’ oor ain coos
was ill, an’ I sent for M. McC., that was a woman
beside us that had <i lang="gd">eolas</i>. As shune as she seen the
coo she said M. McS. was here. That was a woman
folk didna’ like, for they thocht she had a bad e’e.
Says I: ‘Ay, she was here.’ ‘Weel, she did
harm to the coo.’ She gied to the march burn and
lifted water oot o’t in three pairts. The first she
lifted in the name o’ the Father, the second in the
name o’ the Son, and the third in the name o’ the
Holy Ghost. Then she got salt and did the same
wee hit. She pit the first taitie intae the bottle in
the name o’ the Faither, the second in the name
o’ the Son, and the third in the name o’ the Holy
Ghost. She then gied tae a corner o’ the byre and
prayed some prayer. When that was finished she
pit the water in the coo’s ears and some on her
back, an’ then said, ‘She has plenty noo.’ The coo
shune got better. Peter, Paul, and Mary’s names
war in the prayer. She offered to learn me that
<i lang="gd">eolas</i>, but I didna want tae learn’t.”</p>

<p>From an Islay reciter who saw the performance
we have the operation described as follows. She
(the professor) first went on her knees and repeated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</span>
words, then put salt on a paper. This salt she
measured with a thimble painted blue in the inside.
She then put it into a cloth, poured water through
it into a bottle, after which she repeated words over
it and gave the bottle to the man who had come to
consult her about the cow.</p>

<p>The salt seems sometimes to be used dry. We
have mentioned George ——, described as a worthy
man, who was consulted to cure a cow so ill that
the schoolmaster had already advised its owner to
send for a man to flay it. George required that it
should be put in the byre, and it had to be pulled
in by main force with a rope round its horns. This
being accomplished, he told the boys that they might
go now and he would do the rest himself. He
then asked my mother if she had salt, and when she
replied that she had, he ordered her to give him the
full of her hand. She gave him that, and said if there
was anything he would like to have one of the children
would go for it. But he answered, “This will do my
business.” He went back to the <i lang="gd">bothan</i> (byre), and
he began to work the salt in the palm of his hand.
After a good while he came out and said to my
mother, “Your cow is dressed now, Flora.” They
then went to take her out of the <i lang="gd">bothan</i>, but still she
would not walk, and they had to drag her out and
leave her again on the green. With this my father
was after coming back, and a man along with him,
to take the skin off the cow. George advised her to
let her alone, for she would be all right yet. The
cow recovered.</p>

<p>The use of urine as a preventative has been considered
already. The following from an intelligent
woman of about fifty, a farmer’s wife in Kintyre, a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</span>
well-read woman who takes an interest in things which
she admittedly does not believe in, tells that when she
was young, in one farm in Kintyre where she was in
service, her mistress was regularly in the habit of
sprinkling urine (house slops) on every cow after
calving, and before she was allowed to go out, the
intention being to protect the cow from the effects of
the Evil Eye.</p>

<p>In another farm, however, in Kintyre, at the same
time and for the same purpose, salt was sprinkled on
every cow’s back as soon as she had calved. It was
an encouraging sign if the cow licked off the salt,
which was specially sprinkled on either side of the
rump.</p>

<p>It seems quite fair here to consider the salt as a
more civilised representative of the other fluid, though
in fact the latter is of considerable value as a cleanser
under certain circumstances.</p>

<p>Another native of Kintyre informs us that it was a
common custom at farms when the cattle were being
put out on the 1st of May for the mistress to stand
and throw a handful of salt on each as they passed
out of the byre. She saw this done in a farm in the
parish of Campbeltown, and was well aware of it being
a common practice. It was avowedly done against
<i lang="gd">cronachadh</i>.</p>

<p>The writer having no skill in churning, has no knowledge
what result would come from putting of salt in
the churn, but an Arran woman is responsible for the
statement that she had herself often seen salt put into
a churn as a protection against any evil influence.</p>

<p>A careful observer in Islay tells how that at one
time their butter having left them and they had got
none for some weeks, they sent for a woman, a professor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</span>
in the neighbourhood. When she came they
had a churning ready to commence with, but on
examining it she advised that it should be thrown to
the pigs, and added that they must clean and scrub
well all the dishes used for gathering the milk, and
that she would return on the next day they were
ready for a churning. That day having come, the
<i lang="gd">eolas</i> woman returned, and the first thing she did was
to sprinkle a little salt on the bottom of the empty
churn. The milk was then poured in and the churning
commenced, with unexpectedly satisfactory results.
The practitioner here was an <i lang="gd">eolas</i> woman of a very
good sort, and set about her operations in a manner
well calculated to be successful. On the farm, however,
they regarded that butter with suspicion and
sold it.</p>

<p>To judge from what we are told in the following as
having occurred in the north of Ireland, so strong is
the action of salt that it will put matters right with a
bad churning, even though it neither touch cream nor
churn. Failing one day to get their butter properly,
the reciter’s master sent for an old woman in the
immediate neighbourhood. When she came she just
glanced at the churn, and seeing at once what was
wrong, she said to the farmer, “If you like I will show
you the one who has done the harm.” He assured
her that he did not wish that, but would be pleased if
she could do anything with the churning. Without
more ado, so far as W. could see, she took a handful
of salt, which she threw into a pot boiling on the fire.
She then gave a turn or two at the churn, and sure
enough the butter came all right.</p>

<p>We have already mentioned the use of salt in connection
with sugar as put in milk given to a woman<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</span>
suspected of influencing her source of supply, and
from which the dairymaid took the first mouthful as
a sure preventative of evil, not only for the quantity
immediately given, but also for any that would be
supplied subsequently during the season.</p>

<p>One other instance of the use of salt we give on the
authority of an Arran man of about sixty-five years of
age, a shrewd business man, but of whom the collector
says that to judge from appearances he thinks his
knowledge of the island and his family connection
with it extends about as far back as the origin of the
island itself.</p>

<p>He said his father was a great believer in the Evil
Eye. One day a neighbour, walking with him while
ploughing, had spoken in praise of a brown horse that
was in the plough. His acquaintance had hardly left
when the horse turned ill, and lay down and kicked
and groaned. It was unyoked and taken home, and
the Evil Eye being suspected N. R.’s wife was sent
for. She came and got a mixture of salt, soot, and a
lot of other things which she rubbed on the horse.
She felt it all over with her hand to find out the particular
spot where the eye had struck. Whatever did
it, the horse recovered and was quite well afterwards.</p>

<p>The passing the hand over the animal to feel for
material damage is peculiar. This is a usual proceeding
in cases of elf-shot, but not of the Evil Eye; however,
of course the woman was thoroughly entitled to
make her own diagnosis in her own way.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="MOST_SUITABLE_WATER">MOST SUITABLE WATER</h2>
</div>


<p>In the course of the preceding, various sources for
water used to cure Evil Eye have been mentioned.
“A certain well.” This may have been a holy well
of some sort, consecrated by traditional connection
with some saint, though after all it may have been
chosen merely to fulfil the condition mentioned elsewhere
that a spring is preferable. A narrowing of
the choice of springs from which water could be
taken was shown in the case where one of our
reciters told us that, believing the water <i lang="gd">a bhiodh air
a thoirt a tobar o’n taobh deas</i> (should be taken from
a south well), he proceeded to take it from a well
south of his own house, while another mentioned that
the water required to be taken from a spring facing
the south.</p>

<p>While roughly one-half of our reciters have expressed
a preference for well or spring water, the
other half prefer running water. One said “it should
come from a march burn,” and two mentioned “that
it should be from a running stream,” not mentioning
any advantage to be derived from its dividing two
properties. One pointed out that a piece of bread
must be in the possession of the taker. In two other
instances the information was given that it must be
taken where the living and the dead pass. The condition
further annexed that it must be from under
a bridge is probably merely an expression of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</span>
reciter’s own for this same idea. He would probably
have considered stepping-stones, or a commonly used
ford which led to a burial-place, as equally effective.</p>

<p>The specified qualifications really cover all the
usual sources from which water can be drawn.
From a native of Kintail, we hear of a case which was
considered the result of the Evil Eye, though she
spoke of the patient, a boy, having been “injured by
some spell.” He was quickly cured by the sprinkling
of water from a “certain well.”</p>

<p>An Islay reciter was very clear upon the necessity
of choosing “<i lang="gd">uisge fior</i>” (spring water).</p>

<p>From the same island, in a case where a cow was
said to be suffering from “<i lang="gd">buidseachas</i>” (witchcraft),
which in this case seems to mean Evil Eye, the water
was taken in a small tub from the Saligo River. The
cow recovered, so if there is any doubt in any one’s
mind as to a proper source of supply, he can always
procure it in the river running from Lochgorm to the
west of Islay.</p>

<p>Another reciter said that water would be more
efficacious if taken from a point where three parishes
touched each other, or failing that, from a spot from
which three parishes could be seen, and that he knew
of water being frequently taken from a spot which
answered these conditions for healing purposes of
the sort we are considering. This is again an invocation
of the Trinity by suggestion.</p>

<p>A woman who herself practised <i lang="gd">eolas</i>, when asked
whether it mattered what sort of water she used, said
“Oh yes, it must be water from a march over which
the living and dead pass.” The use of this water
need not apparently be accompanied by incantations
and other formulæ.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</span></p>

<p>A reliable informant mentioned a case which came
under her own notice of a Skye woman living at
Kenmore, who, having taken it into her head that a
passing tramp had injured her child with the Evil
Eye, “hurriedly bundling up her child, went with
him to a little river near her house, and washed the
boy under the bridge which was on the main road
there, and the regular thoroughfare, alike for ordinary
passengers and funeral processions.” In fact, a
running water over which the living and the dead
passed.</p>

<p>For dwellers in towns these instructions, if carried
out, might mean considerable trouble, but in one
case at any rate, in Campbeltown, Kintyre, a firm
believer in the Evil Eye, with a view to her own
protection, “used to stand over the water tap in her
own kitchen and allow the water to run while she
repeated some words over the running water.”</p>

<p>The position of some wells undoubtedly makes them
fashionable. One of our informants who has lived at
Crianlarich says that within the last thirty years she
has known people come considerable distances to
take water from a well between the old Priory and
the Kirkton burying-ground, over which the “living
and the dead” were wont to pass. It was taken for
the purpose of curing cattle injured by an Evil Eye.
A silver coin was generally in the vessel in which
they carried away the water. The efficacy of this
cure was commonly, if not universally, believed in by
the people of the place.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="TABOO_WHEN_IN_POSSESSION">TABOO WHEN IN POSSESSION
OF WATER</h2>
</div>


<p>In accordance with all the traditions of magical
observance, we must expect to find the use of this
curative water made dependent upon the observance
of certain rules laid down by the professor. In one
case already cited, a young person going with an
old woman to a well for water, was ordered to keep
silence, even though he himself was not carrying
the water; and this was insisted upon rigidly. This
was in Sutherland.</p>

<p>This insisting on silence is a very common taboo
in other cases.</p>

<p>From an Arran reciter, in the case of an unmarried
woman being sent for the <i lang="gd">pisearachd</i>, as it is there
called, the professor instructed her to go straight
home, no further particulars being mentioned. This
daughter of Eve and Adam sat down at the roadside
and indulged her curiosity in examining what she
had got from the <i lang="gd">eolas</i> woman. Our reciter said,
“After this, of course, it was of no use; for anything
these <i lang="gd">eolas</i> people give for curing should never be
opened till it is going to be used. If it is opened
before that, it will lose its virtue.” At any rate in
this case it did no good, for the cow died.</p>

<p>Anything approaching careful reasoning in folklore
matters is not to be expected, as in religion, faith
takes the first place, and reason, if admitted at all,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</span>
quite a back seat. Sometimes, however, things occur
which tend to diminish superstitious faith and reassert
the advantage of applied reason.</p>

<p>In Arran, a horse was supposed to be suffering
from <i lang="gd">cronachadh</i>. The farmer sent a woman to get
the advice of a professor, W. She had to take care
of a young child at the time, and probably it was not
convenient for her to leave the child at home, anyhow,
she took it with her in a shawl. Having told her
errand to the <i lang="gd">eolas</i> man, he gave her a bottle with
instructions how to use it. On her way home, constantly
hitching up the child on her back, the cork
came out of the bottle, and all that had been put in
it was spilled. When she found this was the case she
was in a “great stew” and wondered what she should
do. She made up her mind that she would fill the
bottle from the burn and say nothing of what had
happened on reaching home if the horse did not get
better; if it did she could tell the truth. She refilled
her bottle, retailed the <i lang="gd">eolas</i> man’s instructions, the
water was applied to the horse in accordance with
these, and recovered. The woman now let out the
secret, which, as may be supposed, somewhat shook
the confidence of the public in the powers of that
individual professor of <i lang="gd">piscarachd</i>.</p>

<p>We have to take these stories as we get them.
Cross-questioning the reciter has various results, from
complete silence and a consequent drying-up of all
information, to an acquiescence in anything they
think will satisfy their interrogators. One is inclined
to believe that in the following case a cracked bottle
was deliberately given to the messenger so as to lead
up to what happened. Our reciter said, “It was just
last week I was speaking to R. G. about the man in R.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</span>
One of his cows was ill, and a boy was sent to a man
who cured cattle that had been <i lang="gd">air an cronachadh</i>.
The boy got a bottle with instructions, and was told,
“I am not sure whether you will get back in time,
but if the bottle does not break on the way and you
can reach home before the cow dies, this will cure
her.” The boy went as fast as he could, but when
almost home the bottle broke in halves, and all that
was in it was lost. He turned back and went as
quick as he could to the <i lang="gd">eolas</i> man, who told him:
“I knew the bottle would break, but I will make
another that will not break, only I’m afraid you will
not be in time.” The boy hurried home to find the
cow dead.</p>

<p>One would have supposed that any one not a fool
would have looked upon this as a trick, but the
reciter, a tradesman who can read and write, really
an intelligent man and shrewd in other matters,
added, “Was it not wonderful that he knew the bottle
would break?” The collector asked him what he
supposed had caused it to break. “Oh, just the
strength of the evil that was inside it. One evil trying
to beat another evil; the man that gave the bottle,
you see, was a strong wizard.” Asked to explain
his idea as expressed by the one evil trying to
beat the other, and was not the man who professed
to cure as bad as the one who had done
the harm, he explained his position by saying:
“Well, no, it is right to do good and to beat the
wicked one.”</p>

<p>The spilling of the water, and consequently the
impossibility of recovering it from the ground, would
naturally put an end to any hope of cure from it,
but it would appear that even laying it down while<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</span>
in the bottle deprived it of its virtue, as already
pointed out.</p>

<p>“When myself and my father,” said a reciter,
“were in service at E——, I was the herd, and one of the
milch cows was attacked and not a drop of milk was
left with her, but there was nothing to be seen wrong.
We had a suspicion of what it was, and I went up to
a worthy, clever man (<i lang="gd">duine corr gasda</i>) that would be
at work curing beasts that were <i lang="gd">air an cronachadh</i>.
When I told him what was wrong he took a bottle
from the corner, while I sat by the fire. It is not
known what he said on the bottle, but when giving it
to me, he said: ‘<i lang="gd">Air na chunnaic mi riomh gun am botal
a leigeil ris a ghrunnd gus an ruiginn dhachaidh</i>’ (‘Upon
what I had ever seen not to let the bottle touch the
ground until I would reach home’), and upon reaching
to put what was in the bottle in the cow’s two ears,
and he said that this would make her that she would
have plenty of milk that same night. When I got
home we did exactly as he had said, and the creature
had plenty milk after that.”</p>

<p>The above occurred in Islay, but the same taboo
was laid on the carriage of a like medicament in
Rothiemurchus. The reciter said: “My mother
was for a while that she could not get any butter.
Whenever she would try to gather it, it would run
like sand. At last her suspicions fell on a woman
in the neighbourhood believed to have the Evil Eye.
My mother was advised to consult a woman supposed
to have skill in these things, then resident in the
parish of Rothiemurchus. When she spoke of it
to my father he did not object, and said he would
speak about it to the woman’s husband, both being
at that time at work about the laird’s house. Next<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</span>
day the woman’s husband promised my father that
he would tell his wife, which he did, and she made
something. I remember quite well being sent to
the woman’s house for the thing that was to cure
the cow; my sister was with me, and the woman
gave us a bottle, and what was in it was just like
clear water. When giving it to us she cautioned
us to be careful of it, for it must not be allowed to
touch the ground until it would reach the cow; and
I remember how very carefully we carried it home,
and how feared we were for it. The cow was made
to swallow it, and whether it was that that did it,
I cannot tell, but I know they believed it was. In
any case, after that the butter came all right.”</p>

<p>The reciter of this, a woman aged about thirty-eight,
was a crofter’s daughter, fairly well educated
and more than usually intelligent.</p>

<p>A very full account of the taboos to be observed
by the carrier of an <i lang="gd">eolas</i> cure comes from a reciter
at Whiting Bay in Arran.</p>

<p>Two men, each having but one horse, were in
the habit of doing their ploughing by uniting the
pair in one team. One day both horses took ill
and the Evil Eye was diagnosed. One of the
owners sent for <i lang="gd">eolas</i> and his horse began to recover;
the other man, who at first expressed disbelief,
seeing his neighbour’s horse improving while his
own did not, sent his niece, on the “sly,” to the
same practitioner, Bean A., for <i lang="gd">pisearachd</i>. It is the
niece who gives us the information. “Well, I went,
and I told her my errand. I had a shawl on my
head. When she heard my errand she went and put
her hand up the lum and took something from
there, and then she went into a corner and took out<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</span>
three wee pokes as black as soot and took something
out of them. She was in the dark, but I
knew that there were stones in the pokes, for I heard
them rattling. She then gave me a paper with something
in it, and told me that I was on no account to
open the paper or let light or air into it till I would
reach home. As soon as I would reach I was to
tell my uncle to put what was in the paper into a
bottle of water, and that he was to sprinkle the water
over the horse, repeating its name three times while
sprinkling it. He was then to pour a little into
each of its ears, and the rest, if there should be any
over, he was to put in its food. These were her
directions, and I went away with the paper; but two
people met me on the road and spoke to me. I
did not answer them properly, for I was afraid, but
just said I ‘<i lang="gd">iim</i>,’ keeping my mouth shut all the time.
I had a strong wish to see what was in the paper,
but was afraid if I would let in light or air it might
be of no use. I resisted the temptation till I was
nearly home, and then, getting behind a dyke, I put
the shawl over my head in such a way that neither
light nor air could get into the paper, as I thought.
When I opened the paper what I saw were three
wee black balls, black as soot, just like balls of soot.
I never let on at home that I had opened the paper,
and my uncle did all as he was ordered to do, and
after a while the horse began to get better. I do
not know whether it was the bottle that cured it,
but it took a good while before it came to be quite
well. People used to say that when a beast or body
was <i lang="gd">air a’ cronachadh</i> it would take as long to complete
the cure after the application of the <i lang="gd">eolas</i> as
had been between the injury and the application of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</span>
the cure. Bean A. assured my uncle afterwards
that it was a person of the name of Stewart that
had done the harm, and there were only three of
that name in the place at that time. Suspicion fixed
on one of them, and by-and-by they began to cast
it up to her. She got angry and went to check my
aunt for reporting a thing of the kind about her.
This was the first my aunt had heard of the cure,
for my uncle wanted to conceal it from her, and she
was very angry with him for having sent to the
<i lang="gd">eolas</i> woman.”</p>

<p>In the above an express proviso was that while
sprinkling the water over the horse its name was to
be repeated three times. The necessity for this was
expressly laid down by a Sutherlandshire reciter who
said, “The person or beast to be cured is made to
drink some of this (silver water), and is also sprinkled
all over with some of it. The sprinkling is done in
the name of the Trinity, and the name of the person
or beast being operated upon must also be mentioned.
This is all that is needed if it is a case of Evil Eye.”</p>

<p>Of course there is a certain amount of pure
swindle in some of these performances.</p>

<p>A lad was sent some miles in Islay for <i lang="gd">eolas</i> for
a sick cow. He gave his account of the case to the
man, who then promised him a bottle. Having got
the bottle and directions for its use, the messenger
put it in his pocket and took his way home. Before
he had got quite half-way, he fancied he heard a
“commotion” in the bottle, which was still in his
pocket. He then discovered that the bottle had
burst (?) and what had been in it had all gone.
Thinking this was not as it should be, after standing
for a minute or two wondering what he should do,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</span>
he made up his mind to go back and tell the scientist
what had happened. Back he went, made his report,
and the man said to him: “Did they manage to
do that to you? I’ll give you a bottle they cannot
break.” He got another bottle ready, waved his
hands over it before giving it to the lad, saying as
he did so, “Here, <i>they</i> cannot break this one, but
the cow will not be saved.” He told the boy who
had injured the cow. <i>They</i> were the doers of
the evil, evidently supposed to be acting with intention
to do injury; so this case might be considered
as one of witchcraft by those concerned
in it.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="WATER_WHERE_APPLIED">WATER, WHERE APPLIED</h2>
</div>


<p>There has been already occasion to mention that the
instruction given with the healing water was to make
the animal swallow some of it, but yet more frequently
to sprinkle it on the beast. The most usual
locality, however, to which it is ordered to be applied
is that of the ears.</p>

<p>A reciter’s father-in-law had a sick horse which
was supposed to have eaten or drunk nothing for
some days. A woman in the neighbourhood was
consulted, who, when she came into the stable, put
some water (?) in the ear of the horse, saying some
words at the same time. The horse, which was lying
down, rose to its feet, began to eat, and recovered.</p>

<p>Another reciter told of her own husband, who got
something in a bottle, which he was ordered to put
a portion of in the horse’s ears, and to sprinkle some
all over its body. As soon as he came home he did
what he had been ordered, the sick horse rose to its
feet, began to eat, and completely recovered.</p>

<p>In another case the reciter’s father had a grey
horse which he described as not being <i lang="gd">uamhasach
bochd</i> (frightfully bad), but it would not eat. To
tempt the horse it was allowed in among their standing
oats, but it would not bend its head to eat a
bite. His father, taking the advice of another, went
to J. R.’s grandmother and told her how the matter
was. She assured him she would not be long in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</span>
giving him what was wanted; she then gave him
a bottle with the instruction, “<i lang="gd">A chuir a cheud da
spuit dhe na bha ’sa bhotal, aon anns gach cluais dhe ’n
t-ainmhidh, agus an corr a chrathadh sios air a mhuidh,
agus air a dhruim agus leigeil leis sruthadh sios air</i>.”
(To put the first two spouts of what was in the
bottle one in each ear of the horse, and to sprinkle
the remainder down on his mane and on his back,
and allow it to run down on him.) In this case
also the horse gave himself a shake, began to eat,
and recovered.</p>

<p>The same formula was applied to cattle. A Kintyre
farmer had a sick cow, and was advised to consult
an <i lang="gd">eolas</i> woman in the neighbourhood. Having no
faith in that sort of thing, it was some time before
he consented, but he did at last on the plea that
it could do no harm. The woman being sent for,
procured water and salt; these she put into the cow’s
ear, reciting some unintelligible form of words. The
cow seemed to brisk up at once, and the result was
so satisfactory that the owner’s sister-in-law, who was
present at the performance and had previously taken
up a position of unbelief, said to him, “I think, J.,
there is something in it after all.”</p>

<p>We have already given the particulars of how two
beautiful quey calves were affected by the Evil Eye
of a woman who stared at them over the field dyke.
One died, but the other was cured by what appeared
to be pure water which the owner was told to put
in the ear of the sick calf. When this was done it
shook its head, got on its feet, and recovered.</p>

<p>These cases all get the credit of being recoveries.
But a Dumbartonshire case was less successful.
When the reciter was in service one of the cows<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</span>
took ill, and old J. W., who was always in the byres
and well acquainted with cattle, insisted that the beast
was ill from the influence of some one <i lang="gd">aig am bheil
droch shuil</i> (who had an Evil Eye). Nothing would
satisfy him till a woman, A. T., was sent for. She did
not find it convenient to come herself, but sent a
bottle with water in it, instructing the messenger how
to put it in the cow’s ear. The instructions were
carefully carried out, but the cow died.</p>

<p>Any person who had been made to shudder by
the inside of the ear being tickled, would see at once
how the animal was recalled to activity.</p>

<p>The following, from a native of Tiree, shows either
that he had forgotten the instruction given to put the
water directly into the ears, or the professor, while still
remembering the shaking of the head as sign of
returning activity, had contented himself with the
simple sprinkling. It was the reciter’s cousin who
went to the <i lang="gd">eolas</i> man, and who, having “made up a
bottle,” told him to sprinkle it on the horse when he
would reach home; and if it would shake its ears when
the stuff would go on it, he said it would live, but if
not they need do no more, for it would die. Our
information was that the thing was done according to
the directions given, as soon as the horse felt the
water it shook its ears, and as the <i lang="gd">eolas</i> man had said,
recovered.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="ODD_CURES">ODD CURES</h2>
</div>

<p>There are some odd cures mentioned in individual
cases.</p>


<h3>HONEYSUCKLE CURE</h3>

<p>From a good correspondent in the North of Argyllshire
comes the following account of a clerk in a
factor’s office. He complained at times, and certainly
did not look very well, but not much attention was
paid to him, as any illness he had did not seem serious.
“A frail old woman came into his parents’ house one
evening as the lad returned to supper. She looked
at him keenly, waited till he went out, and then asked,
‘What is he complaining of?’ His mother was
surprised, but answered that he was feeling the confinement
in his office a good deal, but that there was
not much wrong. ‘You need not tell me that,’ said
the old woman, ‘I can easily see there is something
very real the matter with him. Some one has laid
their Evil Eye upon him. I’ll tell you what you
should do. Go to the woods, get a good long bit of
the <i lang="gd">iadh-shlait</i>, take it and twist it this way round his
whole body, repeating the following words, and you
will see your son hale and hearty soon.’ The lad’s
mother did not believe in the cure and did not try
it, nor could she give the words recommended to
be used.” The plant here is the honeysuckle, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</span>
Gaelic name given being used for it alone in the
district. Dictionaries, however, say that it is also
used for “ivy,” which in those parts as elsewhere is
called <i lang="gd">eitheann</i>.</p>


<h3>CAT CURE</h3>

<p>The reciter, a probationer of the Free Church and
well up in folklore matters, when in Harris, of which
he was a native, heard of the following. A man’s
cow was taken suddenly ill, and the only conclusion
they could come to was that it was a case of Evil Eye.
The owner of the cow, acting on advice, took a cat
and rubbed it on the cow. The cow recovered.</p>


<h3>RUBBING HAIR THE WRONG WAY</h3>

<p>The reciter’s grandfather was a Stratherrick man
(Loch Ness), and when attending the market there,
was approached by another man to sell him a stirk.
There was a good deal of bargaining. No agreement
was come to, the offerer leaving as if dissatisfied.
Before the market closed the stirk fell to the ground
and could not be got to rise. F.’s suspicions of
course fell upon the rejected offerer. An acquaintance
who also was attending the market, and was supposed
to have eolas, happened to come about, and seeing F.
in distress reassured him: “<i lang="gd">Cha’n eagal do’n bheachan a
laochain</i>.” (“No fears of the beast, my lad.”) He then
drew the palm of his hand up the stirk’s back against
the hair, repeating words which the reciter, however,
had never heard. The stirk got on its feet and was
soon brisk and well.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</span></p>


<h3>CHANGING THE FIREPLACE</h3>

<p>“There was a man living in Machri whose cattle and
horses were dying, and things generally going against
him. He knew quite well it was the Evil Eye, so he
consulted a <i lang="gd">buidseach</i>. The <i lang="gd">buidseach</i> told him to
change his fire to the other end of the house.
Having done this his cattle recovered, and he was
prosperous ever after.”</p>

<p>Unfortunately this is the whole information
available. The cattle not improbably were housed
beneath the same roof as himself; but it would be
of no benefit speculating as to the effect of changing
the fireplace nearer to or farther from his stock.
All that can be said is that the change of position
of the fireplace was credited with a change in the
man’s luck.</p>


<h3>THE POWER OF A CHILD’S MUTCH</h3>

<p>Whether the child in this case was suffering
directly from the Evil Eye the reciter was not
prepared to say.</p>

<p>In the neighbourhood of Tayinloan, Kintyre, there
were several women who professed to be able to cure
sicknesses arising from the Evil Eye. One of these
women was sent for in the case of a child thought
to be dying. When she arrived the household were
gathered round the child, thinking he was approaching
immediate death. When the woman looked at
him she said nothing, but asked for a child’s mutch
(close cap), and when it was given her she went
outside, repeated a charm over it, and returning, put<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</span>
the mutch on the child’s head and said he would soon
be well. In a little while he kicked and stretched
himself, and it was not long till he was all right.</p>


<h3>WHISKY CURE</h3>

<p>In only one case have we heard of this universal
solvent of misfortune being used as a cure for the
Evil Eye. The churning was unsuccessful; the
dairymaid was convinced that it was a case of Evil
Eye, and advised that a glass of whisky should be
put in the churn. The advice was not taken, so we
have still to learn the effects of whisky in like case.
This was in Caithness-shire, where belief in the Evil
Eye is very common.</p>


<h3>LEAD DROPPING</h3>

<p>We have already considered the reference of the
diagnosis to the augury of a piece of silver sticking
to the bottom of a dish. All sorts of prognostications
are got by pouring albumen of eggs into water as
well as melted lead; the latter was used in the following
instance of what it disclosed as a case of
Evil Eye.</p>

<p>The reciter was a well-educated sick-nurse, of
middle age and thoroughly reliable. A girl had taken
suddenly ill. A young man in the neighbourhood
was desirous of marrying her, but the suitor was not
acceptable, and the girl took every opportunity of
letting this be seen. A neighbour, supposed to have
special skill and whose method of hanky-panky was
the dropping of melted lead into water, was consulted.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</span>
She went through her performance and
showed the lead, part of it at least, in the form of a
heart with a hole through it. She explained to the
sick girl, “Look at that, his eye is in you and you are
far better to take him.” The match was made, and
the girl recovered her health. The same woman,
going through the same performance with reference
to a sick lad, showed to his aunt and sister some of
the lead in the form of a coffin, and from that pronounced
the case hopeless. The lad shortly thereafter
died.</p>

<p>In the case of the pierced heart, there is no doubt,
the idea on the part of the reciter was that actual
illness was brought on by the desirous eye of the
young man, not merely that the lad had an eye to
her as a satisfactory partner.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="AN_EYE_FOR_AN_EYE">AN EYE FOR AN EYE</h2>
</div>


<p>We have pointed out that the belief in an Evil Eye
is founded upon a literal acceptance apparently of
the validity of the commandment “Thou shalt not
covet.” To the writer this seems the hardest of the
Decalogue. It forbids thoughts which pass involuntarily
through the mind. A person to whom Nature
has given an ambitious and acquisitive disposition
breaks this commandment necessarily, however openhanded
may be his practice. With all reverence,
the commandment seems to be a pushing into the
region of thought what has been forbidden in practice
by the commandment “Thou shalt not steal.” No
doubt to covet means more than a simple liking to
possess, and it is the inordinate, the excessive desire
which is forbidden. The theory of the Evil Eye as
demonstrated in the beliefs of the West Highlanders
shown here may have sprung entirely, and owe their
origin to, if not the tenth commandment of the
Decalogue, an acceptance as valid of the instruction
therein contained. The acceptance of this commandment
as binding, demonstrates that there is a power
for evil in thought alone. The covetous man’s eye
is “in it,” let him do as he likes. This power is
shown vividly by the belief so often expressed that
admiration of one’s own possessions will result in
evil to them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</span></p>

<p>To counteract this deleterious result the possible
sufferer has to be put under the protection of a higher
Power, and so, if the person coveting remembers,
a simple “God bless” will ward off evil. But the
Evil Eye is not the sole property of the active-minded
Christian, and even when it is so it is not necessarily
a simple matter to suggest to him that he is breaking
the tenth commandment; in fact there may be a
difference of opinion on the matter, and it will not
do to leave to the other’s goodwill your security
from loss and damage. A curative ritual has been
excogitated. In these ceremonies the Trinity is frequently
made, or, let us say, called on to take a part.
The curative water is prepared on three metals—gold,
silver, and copper—the magic thread has three knots
on it, and sickness thus divided into three is destroyed,
say by burning two portions, one in the name of the
Father, the other of the Son, while that given over
to the influence of the Holy Spirit, which may be
naturally supposed to counteract the covetous instinct,
remains attached to the sufferer in the third
and unburned knot. To show that this symbolism
is carried out fairly consistently, we would call attention
here to the use of the three-knot charm in the
procuring for sailors of a favouring breeze. Readers
must take it on our authority that there are numberless
accounts of the giving of a three-knotted thread
for this purpose, and the usual instructions for its
use fully bear out our contention. After starting one
knot is to be unloosed, and the breeze will be favouring
and probably gentle. To expedite matters the
second knot may be untied, and the result will be
increase in the force of the favouring wind, but on
no account must the third knot be interfered with,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</span>
or the breeze will rise to a gale, and none will be
able to answer for the effect. Compare the above
statement with what appears in the Gospel of St.
John iii. 8: “The wind bloweth where it listeth,
and thou hearest the sound thereof, but canst not
tell whence it cometh, and whither it goeth: so is
every one that is born of the Spirit.” Add to this
Genesis i. 2: “And the Spirit of God moved upon
the face of the waters.”</p>

<p>This is not to be considered as a reasonable deduction
from the texts quoted. It merely shows that
the authority may seem to give support to a connection
being suggested as existing between the Spirit
of God, and the Holy Spirit of the Trinity, and the
uncertainty and force of the wind which is put under
its governance.</p>

<p>But when we come to symbols and metaphors we
open a wide field which need not be restricted by
what is within the domain of the Church. The fact
stares us in the face that the <i lang="gd">uisge a chronachaidh</i>
(the water of (against) injury) is more frequently
prepared from one metal—silver—even than from
three. It is in fact frequently called Silver Water.
There can be here no traceable connection with a
Trinity. The idea seems to be that the white metal
represents an eye. Seeing that the principal medium
of exchange among the people is silver, as things go,
it is not very far fetched to make a silver coin stand
for what is acknowledged to be hurtful from the point
of view of covetousness, seeing that St. Paul tells
us, 1 Timothy vi. 10, that “the love of money is the
root of all evil.” Having this in mind, we can easily
see how the adherence of a silver coin to the bottom
of a wooden or other vessel comes to be relied on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</span>
as settling the cause of an illness, whether it be the
Evil Eye or something else. The round white coin
staring at you, as it were, from the bottom of the
cogue says “Eye” as distinctly as it is possible. If
it does not adhere no suggestion of an eye is made,
consequently the sickness in question arises from
something else. We do not hear of a copper, and
very rarely of a gold coin being used by itself. We
hear of gold being used in the form of the marriage
ring, but the symbolism here is the same as in the
serpent stones and the honeycombed stones in
Kintyre, it represents an eye by its form.</p>

<p>A reciter from the Chanonry, Ross-shire, says he has
frequently seen women take the ring off their finger,
and hurriedly putting water on it in a dish, dash the
water over their children if they saw a person coming
to call about whom they had any suspicion. This
was with a view to prevent <i lang="gd">cronachadh</i>, either witchcraft
or the Evil Eye.</p>

<p>This connection with an eye explains also how
the giving away of a darning needle means the giving
away of one’s luck. This seems somewhat peculiar
to the island of Arran. We give the following as
a sample:—</p>

<p>An Arran reciter said: “Bettie many a time tells
me of a woman they have beside them who never
darns stockings or anything else. One day this
woman came in and asked Bettie for a darning
needle. Bettie suspected it was for no good end
she wanted it and would have refused it, but the
woman having seen it went and took it with her.
For some time thereafter Bettie was very unlucky.
Things were going against her, and one night she
dreamed that somebody came to her and said, ‘Why<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</span>
did you give away your darning needle? You
have given away your luck with it.’ When she got
up in the morning she just went into the woman’s
house, and seeing the darning needle stuck in a pincushion,
she went and took it with her.”</p>

<p>Bettie here had given away the magic eye of its
owner, which acted as a counter charm to the Evil
Eyes of others. The above is not the only power
inherent in a darning needle in Arran. There,
stuck in the cap or bonnet, it is as complete
protection against the under-world as represented
by fairies, as elsewhere a knife is frequently quoted
as being.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="SHOWING_WHO_IS_THE_MISCHIEF">SHOWING WHO IS THE MISCHIEF
MAKER</h2>
</div>


<p>We are so easily content to waive aside these superstitions
when they come in our way, as if they were
the unconsidered dreamings of the insane. Not one
of them but has its origin, generally no doubt in a
misguided fancy, but still based on something real
enough to the mind of the believer, even if it be a
mind of childlike simplicity. But when <i lang="gd">eolas</i> men
and women take on themselves to find out for the
instruction of their clients to whom the Evil Eye
damaging them belongs, one begins to doubt but
that there is more of the wisdom of the serpent
than of the simplicity of the dove in this part of
their performance. We have already mentioned a
case in which the <i lang="gd">eolas</i> woman described to the
reciter’s cousin “exactly” the man and woman who
had harmed her child, though neither man nor
woman had been mentioned to her, and the reciter
expressed wonder at the knowledge so displayed.</p>

<p>This spotting the doer is evidently a little more
difficult of belief to many than the other notions
they entertain about the Evil Eye. Thus, a reciter
says that one professor confirmed the owner’s suspicions,
a fact openly admitted, but added, “It was
said that she told them whose eye had taken the
milk away.” In another, “It was believed he could
also tell who had done the mischief?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</span></p>

<p>But in some cases the individual is straightforwardly
given. Five reciters at least mentioned that, and
in one of these the reciter accepted the nomination
as indubitable because they had met “the very man
she mentioned on the road.”</p>

<p>There can be no doubt that some of these <i lang="gd">eolas</i>
people have deliberately offered to disclose the personality
of the one doing the harm. The owners of the
sick animal have refused to have such information
given them, stating that they would be entirely content
with a cure without knowing any ill of a neighbour.
Refinement of feeling of this sort is foreign to
many, however, and indeed it is to be excused in a
thorough believer, if for no other reason than the
well-known principle that “prevention is better than
cure.” Some of the indications are particularly
vague.</p>

<p>“He asked if a dark-haired man had been praising
the cow, and when they said that they didn’t know,
‘Well,’ said he, ‘it was a man with black hair (<i lang="gd">ceann
dubh</i>) that injured your cow, with the Evil Eye!’”</p>

<p>In another case the identified doer, as previously
mentioned, had brown hair.</p>

<p>In some cases, though no names are mentioned, it is
quite clear that identification was intended. Thus, in
one of the cases cured by a cord, the professor stated
that the child had been injured by a mother and her
daughter. “My man said that that was quite true, but
that they had no ill-will to us, and why should they
do that?” To that the woman said, “That it was
likely that they did not know themselves that they
were doing it.”</p>

<p>In another thread-cured case, the man operating
said that it had been injured by drovers who wanted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</span>
to buy the animal in question. We may conclude
that the <i lang="gd">eolas</i> man knew that drovers had been in the
neighbourhood.</p>

<p>Similar cases have already been mentioned, the
particularity of the description pretty clearly demonstrating
that the professor would have been more
candid if, instead of asking whether a dark and
a fair woman with a blue shawl had been calling,
they had said there had been, and that they were
responsible.</p>

<p>But this describing the individual without naming
him is evidently a trick of the trade. A farmer’s wife
consulting an <i lang="gd">eolas</i> man without at first the consent of
the farmer, the professor described to the couple the
appearance of the man who had done the mischief.
We then learn that from the description they knew at
once who the man was, and also that he had been in
the byre shortly before the cow had taken ill.</p>

<p>It was probably a safe enough decision to credit
strange drovers with an injury of the sort, their
stay in the district being of course but a temporary
one; but one suspects local jealousy in the following
case, when a woman, desirous of getting back her
vanished butter, was told that those doing the injury
were not a musket-shot from her house. This
was in Islay, and some Jura people staying in the
neighbourhood, it was concluded they were those
pointed at.</p>

<p>A parallel appears in the case already mentioned,
where all Tiree <i lang="gd">cailleachs</i> are slumped as dangerous.
One suspects that in the following case an undesirable
neighbour had been suggested.</p>

<p>There were three farmers side by side in the parish
of Kilbrandon. The one in the centre was not nearly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</span>
so successful as his neighbours. The unfortunate
farmer went to A—— to consult a certain <i lang="gd">eolas</i> man.
By him he was told it was no wonder he was not getting
on, for he had on each side of him “those who were
doing him harm, and until he would remove he
would never get on.” Taking the hint he looked
about him, removed to another farm, and succeeded
very well.</p>

<p>When in doubt, the professor, in some cases at
any rate, acquires by examination assurance of the
presence of an individual to accuse. Having put
the string on a sick cow and the cow being cured
apparently, “she (the <i lang="gd">eolas</i> woman) came to the lassie
that had been herding the cow and said to her: ‘You
saw a man among the cows to-day, and you heard
him saying that that cow was a good one.’” The girl
said, “Yes.” The woman then said: “The man was
J. G.,” and the girl again said, “Yes.” The woman
then told them that it was the said J. G. who had done
the harm. They all knew him quite well. “And
now,” added Mrs. M. in telling her story, “if that
woman had no knowledge, how could she have known
who had been among the cows on that day, or who
had done the mischief.”</p>

<p>In some cases a description is given of a method of
identification of the owner of the Evil Eye. Formerly
we described how a woman consulted shut her eyes,
and opening them after an interval, informed her interrogator
that anything she saw of the nature of a
burden was what was pressing on the sick animal. In
that instance it was said to be a horse collar.</p>

<p>Probably in this case the woman satisfied herself
of the gravity of the illness by comparing it with the
relative weight of the burden.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</span></p>

<p>In another case in which Thursday and Sunday
were said to be the lucky days for the preparation of
the <i lang="gd">uisge a chronachaidh</i>, and it took from Wednesday
to Sunday to prepare the stuff, the blame was at the
end of that time laid to the charge of a stranger from
Tiree. One can scarcely doubt that in that case the
time was utilised to make inquiries.</p>

<p>In addition to these more crude methods there
are indications of the dark-room business carried on
in more civilised places almost to the present day.
There was a man who lived at Balloch in the island
of Lewis much consulted, and believed to be specially
skilful in dealing with cases of the Evil Eye. “For a
consideration he would produce the likeness of those
who had done the harm, showing it to the injured.
He would take them into a little room he had, where
he would show them the likeness of the owner of the
Evil Eye.”</p>

<p>Another traditional method of identification was
“to make some one pass before the inquirer, and the
one who had done the harm would be of the same
name.” We say traditional in this case, because we
have no information about smoke-raising, crystal balls,
or anything of the kind, and are therefore inclined to
refer it back to the Biblical account of Saul’s interview
with Samuel.</p>

<p>That the story of the magic mirror has found its
way into the Western Highlands, however, is made
clear by the following. A lighthouse-keeper is our
informant.</p>

<p>Five men meeting his neighbour outside the lighthouse
stopped him and informed him that having
left their boat on the beach, when they went back to
it they found it had a hole, and they wished to see in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</span>
the looking-glass who had done the mischief. When
the lighthouse-keeper assured them that he had no
such looking-glass, and expressed astonishment that
they would believe in such nonsense, they seemed
somewhat displeased. In recounting this incident
afterwards the light-keepers learned that an impression
had gone abroad in the place that there was a particular
mirror at the station that had the property of
showing who those were that had taken part in cases
of witchcraft. It is easily comprehensible how the
reflectors in a lighthouse might be spoken of as of
peculiar efficacy, with the usual “Three Crows”
result.</p>

<p>The difficulty of course is to distinguish between
claims advanced of the possession of a power, of
which, under the circumstances, a demonstration
cannot be demanded, and the actual carrying out of
some impressive hanky-panky. The following is an
illustration:—</p>

<p>A messenger being sent for a cure, and having
received it, the scientist told him that if the cow had
been his own she could make the shadow (<i>faileas</i>) of
the one who had done the mischief to pass before
him, or, if the woman who was the owner of the cow
had come, she could have done it for her.</p>

<p>One can scarcely be accused of a want of Christian
charity if he suggests that if the professor had had the
owner before him he would not have claimed the
powers he did.</p>

<p>In the story already related of Campbell of Skipness
showing the injurious one in a carefully darkened
barn, the reciter, also a Campbell, had all the appearance
of believing in the story, but as it was told of
a relative of his great-grandfather’s, no one can say<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</span>
what are the accretions time has added to the facts
of the case.</p>

<p>We have pointed out that even the Church has
been brought in contact with the Evil Eye scientist,
and the following information from a well-informed,
clever, middle-aged lady, the sister of a clergyman
whose father took an interest in traditional Gaelic
matters, as she does herself, was heard from a
Sutherlandshire minister who recited it to her mother.
The milk of their cows being unsatisfactory, the housekeeper
asked leave to consult an <i lang="gd">eolas</i> man. The
minister was very angry, but the housekeeper stuck
to her text and carried out her purpose, telling the
minister, “<i>Na gabhadh sibhse gnothuch sam bith leis, agus
chi mise de ni mi</i>.” (“Take you nothing to do with it, and
I’ll see what I’ll do.”) She got the <i lang="gd">eolas</i> man, and he
asked for a basin of the sort of watery stuff they were
getting instead of milk. When he got it he closed up
every hole and crevice, even stuffing up the key-hole.
Then he put the milky water on the fire, and when it
was hot he took a knife and began to cut with it
through the pot of milk. While at this work a woman
came to the door, screamed, and wanted to get in;
but he cried to her that he would give her plenty of
it, and he continued cutting away through the milk.
Still she screamed and begged him to let her come
in, but he said he would not until she would promise
to give up her wicked work and give the <i>toradh</i> back
to the minister’s cow, all the time continuing cutting
with the knife. She answered she would promise
everything he wanted, for every cut of the knife was
going through her heart. The man then opened the
door and took the pot off the fire, and from that time
the supply of milk, both for quantity and quality, was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</span>
satisfactory. In this case also, though the authority is
thoroughly respectable, it is impossible to say what
actually took place. In fact it may be that our
informant may have mistaken a traditional recitation
as the experience of the reciter himself. Though told
àpropos of the Evil Eye, looking at the story in all its
bearings, it looks as if it had been, if it happened at
all, a case of pull devil pull baker between two witches,
one of whom was supposed to be taking the minister’s
milk.</p>

<p>But your witch, male or female, still exists, and his
presence probably does not conduce to harmony in
his neighbourhood. Two brothers lived beside the
father of our reciter in J——. They had a bit of land
between them, and their dwelling-houses stood end to
end under one roof. The wife of the one brother
suspected the wife of the other of injuriously affecting
her dairy products by the Evil Eye. She persuaded
her husband to take her part, and he crossed to I——
to consult one having the reputation of witchcraft there.
The witch resolved to go in person to examine into
the matter, and he accompanied the man home, where
he assured the couple who considered themselves
injured that he would bring the injurer crying to
their door. The suspected woman, already much
annoyed, sent for the reciter’s mother to come to
her, who found her sitting in tears. The visitor encouraged
her, told her it was all nonsense and
advised her not to be downcast, and returned home.
Shortly thereafter she had a visit from the woman
complaining, who told her with glee that the man
consulted had put them on a plan for finding out
who was injuring their milk. The mutual friend
received this information coldly, and proceeded to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</span>
point out that there were no grounds for suspecting
any one outside her own house, and advised her
to go home, well clean her dishes and keep her eye
on her daughter, assuring her that if she did that
she would probably have satisfaction with her milk
and cream. The result was quite satisfactory, as it
turned out to be as suspected, that the daughter helped
herself in her mother’s absence.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="PUTTING_ELSEWHERE">PUTTING ELSEWHERE</h2>
</div>


<p>The procedure of the <i lang="gd">eolas</i> woman in Bernera
(Harris), given above, burning two of the knots of
the charmed string to carry off the disease, stating
as she put each knot in the fire, “The disease and
the sickness I would put on the top of the fire,” it
is evident that the evil was treated as something
capable of being destroyed, in that case by the
action of fire. The same idea appears in the
following:—</p>

<p>The reciter remembered when misfortune came
to their cattle. One cow after another died, and
then a horse died, and her brother, a good deal
older than herself, saying he could stand it no longer,
went to consult an <i lang="gd">eolas</i> man. The latter professed
to understand the case, said it was an Evil Eye that
had done the mischief, and offered there and then
to make the individual appear before him so that
he would know who it was. Her brother refused to
accept this offer, and the proposition made to him
then was that the illness should be transferred to
the cattle of the wrong-doer. This also met with
disapproval, and then it was proposed that the illness
should be thrown in the sea. The cure in this
case was connected with waving the tether over
the sick horse.</p>

<p>In another Islay case where the <i>dosgach</i> was
supposed to have come to the locality with a newlymarried<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</span>
wife of one of two brothers, a reputed curer
was consulted. He made out that it was a case of
<i>buidseachas</i>, and he offered to put the <i>dosgach</i> on any
of the consulters’ neighbours’ cattle. This did not
meet with the farmer’s approval, as he was unwilling
that his neighbours should suffer, so he declined to
mention any name, but recommended that the evil
effect should be put in the sea. One can scarcely
doubt that, there being cattle sickness in the district,
the chances were in favour of the cattle of any named
person being affected, so that even if the offer had
been accepted and the farmer committed himself as
desiring harm to his neighbour, the <i lang="gd">eolas</i> man’s credit
or discredit would have been maintained. He must
by this time have had a fair idea of the disposition of
the man he was dealing with, and probably expected
that his offer next made to show him for half-a-crown
the individual in fault would be refused. It was so,
and the reciter gave the reason for this refusal, viz.
that it would be <i>an t-aibhisdear</i> (the adversary, the
devil), who would appear in the likeness of a man.
This explains sufficiently the reason influencing those
who refuse such offers, even if one did see an appearance
which was recognisable. The evidence that the
individual shown did it was unreliable. The devil
has been a deceiver from the beginning, and if the
vision was that of him masquerading, doubtless for
his own purposes, he might be deceiving the inquirer.</p>

<p>The above story was told by the daughter of one
of the two brothers concerned, and she vouches for
the truth of it, having heard her father and uncle
talk of it often and often. She added a curious
incident, which seems to have had something to do
with the diagnosis of the case. The man consulted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</span>
the “Red Witch,” as he was called, and sent the farmer
back “for the twelve points of the sick cow.” It was
explained that this meant the tips of the horns, ears,
hoofs, &amp;c. These were examined, and the opinion
expressed that the cow could not be cured, for the
mischief had got too near her heart, but it could be
lifted from all the rest, so that it would not trouble
them any more. She further explained that they
were led to understand that it was two brothers who
were doing the harm, and we notice that it was two
brothers who were consulting the witch doctor. She
said that the sickness was put into the sea.</p>

<p>From another case we get information of how
this could be done. “A stirk of my father’s was ill,
and we sent to a man for a cure. He sent a bottle
with instructions that part of it was to be sprinkled
on the stirk, and the rest thrown into the sea. As
soon as what was in the bottle went on the beast,
its horns got warm. We threw the rest of the stuff
into the sea as ordered, and after that the stirk got
quite well.”</p>

<p>It has been pointed out already that there is no
witchcraft necessary to the Evil Eye, but that the
processes for its cure undoubtedly are witchcraft.
The following will show the idea prevalent as to the
powers of transferring illness.</p>

<p>The reciter, an Islay woman, said: “There was a
lad at service with Malcolm here beside us. He was
one of the T.’s. He used to come our way, and
my father said to me not to have too much to do
with him, for there was something wrong about him
(hereditary witch power). Well, while that lad was
beside us every foal that we had died. One day my
father went towards the march between ourselves<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</span>
and Malcolm. It was pretty early, and he noticed
the dog sniffing between two little hillocks there.
He went over to see what the dog was at, and what
did he find but a foal’s head buried under the ground.
It was the head of a foal of Malcolm’s that had died,
and the lad had buried it at our march to put the
trouble upon us. My father was terribly angry (<i>fuasach
angrach</i>), for he would not do the like to another man.
He lifted the head and threw it into a drain, where it
would not do any harm and away from every man.
<i>Ach coma leibh</i> (but all the same), the time of one of
our mares was out, and when she cast (her foal), what
was there but two heads on the foal.” The reciter
went on to say that that lad left Malcolm and went to
Fair Peter, but Peter got his burning with him, for
while he was with him the foals were dying on him,
Besides the harm that was done to what belonged to
his master, he (the lad) got a piece of a dead calf
and put it on a neighbour’s land, and with this that
neighbour’s calves “began to go on him.”</p>

<p>This story was told apparently with full belief,
and the only conclusion we can draw from it,
seems either that some cattle sickness prevailing in
the neighbourhood was credited to the unfortunate
lad, or else that for some revengeful or other
purpose of his own he had damaged the stock of
his master.</p>

<p>We have another account of the same belief from
a native of Kilbrandon, Seil Island, where a belief
in the Evil Eye was exceedingly common. He said:
“When a beast dies, there being a suspicion that
the death has been caused by such an Eye, the
owner buries it stealthily, not on his own ground,
but on the ground of some other person, the idea<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</span>
being that if buried on his own ground the influence
of the Evil Eye would be likely to remain, and he
might lose still more beasts, but by burying the
animal on the ground of another he transfers the
evil from himself to the person on whose land it
was buried.” The reciter knew of the following instance
of this:—</p>

<p>A very superstitious family, who believed in and
were much afraid of witchcraft and the Evil Eye,
lost some of their beasts and were quite sure that
the Evil Eye was the cause of death. The head
of the family, watching a convenient opportunity,
went at night and buried them in the dunghill of
another man who lived a distance of about two
miles from him. No one knew this at the time, and
it was only when putting out the manure they found
the remains of the beasts and came to know that
they had been buried there.</p>

<p>It would be unfair to encourage the belief that
the professors of <i lang="gd">eolas</i> always give themselves to
spreading evil reports of neighbours. One being
called in where the butter supply was unsatisfactory,
after advising the use of earthenware dishes in preference
to wooden ones for gathering the milk, the
dairymaid asked if she could tell her who had taken
the <i>toradh</i>. The answer was, “Is not your name
A.?” On being answered that that was so, the <i lang="gd">eolas</i>
woman said, “It may have been yourself.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="APPENDIX">APPENDIX</h2>
</div>


<p>An attempt has been made to give an honest account
without literary varnish of the present-day influence
of the belief in an Evil Eye in the Gaelic-speaking
districts of Scotland. It is difficult to be certain
that nothing of moment has escaped observation.
The influence of Bible texts, no doubt used divorced
from their contexts generally, as well as the protective
power of the Divinity, have been pointed
out as influencing the superstitious. One other
instance we would give from the island of Luing,
which has been handed in since the rest has been
in type.</p>

<p>The reciter said: “I knew a real good woman
who always, when the first meal of the season was
got from the mill, sent a pitcherful of it here and
there to the poor people round about. But there
were some to whom she would give none, because
she suspected them of having evil in their hearts,
and that if they got a pitcherful they could take
all the strength out of what she kept for her house
use. You see, Hezekiah should not have shown
the King of Babylon all his treasures.” Compare
2 Kings xx. 12-19, and Isaiah xxxix. Evidently
the idea was that the King of Babylon was envious
of Hezekiah’s possessions, as the others might have
been of the good lady’s meal.</p>

<p>Mention has been made of the belief that the Evil
Eye could split the rocks themselves. A traditional<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</span>
account of such an incident comes from the island
of Coll. “One time a man was carrying a quern
(hand corn-mill) on his back in a poke, and was met
by a servant of St. Columba. Thinking the quern
was a cheese, he coveted it, and when the man came
to take it out of the bag he found it in two. Columba
said of it, ‘<i>B’e farmad na suil a bhris a’ chlach</i>.’(‘It
was the envy of the eye that broke the stone.’)” The
same story reached us at the same time from a
Breadalbane source. A local laird who hurt his own
cattle, and whose dairymaid had to slam the byre
door in his face, met a girl on her way home from
the shieling. The girl had a quern (<i>muileann brath</i>)
in a bag on her back. When she passed the laird
looked after her, and supposing what she was carrying
was a <i>ceapag caise</i> (a small cheese), he put his
eye in it. When the girl reached home the mill-stone
was in halves, his Evil Eye had broken it.</p>

<p>Some verses describing the powers of a certain

</div>
</div>

<p>The respected correspondent who sends this and
the writer differed as to the word here translated
“wound.” The original spelling suggested that
<i>gonadh</i> was the word, and it corresponds with the
other information received in like cases, but the
reciter explained, and sticks to it, that it means “to
covet.” Now the word <i>gionach</i> means “greedy”
“gluttonous,” and <i>gonadh</i> means “wounding” “bewitching,”
thus, <i>gonadh ort</i> is a form of imprecation.
The philologist will tell us they have nothing to do
with each other, and this may be admitted from his
point of view, but not from the popular one.</p>

<p>Murdoch here immortalised was credited with the
power of destroying the winter supply of beef, even
after the slaughter of the animal. “When I was a
little lad, my father and my uncle William bought a
cow from him in winter. It was customary to buy
a fat cow, kill it, and divide it so as to have a cheap
and good supply. The beast was killed and hung
in the barn. The same day Murdoch passed, and
they knew that on returning he would call to see
how the animal bought from himself turned out
after killing. They were in a fix to prevent his
seeing her without offending him, and the plan they
took was to close the barn, locking the door and
giving the key to some one who, if inquiries were
made, would not tell where it was. Murdoch called,
asked if the cow was killed, and said he wanted to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</span>
see her. They then proceeded to the barn, but of
course could not get in. An apparent search was
then made for the missing key, which naturally they
could not find. Murdoch was disappointed, but
asked if she had killed well. They said she had, and
expressed regret that they could not let him see her.
So they prevented him laying his eye upon her after
killing; before that, while she was his own, of course
his eye would not harm her.” The latter remark is
not in accordance with the belief in other places.</p>

<p>A native of Bute enables us to give another illustration
of care taken to keep an Evil Eye from
dead meat. A woman of whom, as our reciter said,
there could be no doubt she had a “bad eye,” asked
some fishers to take her along the coast in their
boat. Not liking to refuse, they agreed. They had
a fine catch of salmon with them at the time, which
she praised loudly as they lay in the net at her
feet. “Well, for many a day after that we got no
good from that net. We might every bit as well
look to the hills for fish as to it, and were quite
sure it was that woman that had taken its luck from
it with her ‘bad eye.’ Many a time after that we
had to try to keep things out of her sight, and it
was not easy; she would be up and out as early as
ourselves, no matter how early we would be. I have
seen us up at four in the morning, and even at two,
trying to get the salmon boxed before she would
get her eyes on them.”</p>

<p>We must add one other protective formula from
the neighbourhood of Ardrishaig. “This,” said the
reciter, “is a good protection against injury by an
Evil Eye. I used it always with reference to the
young chickens, and found it kept them from being<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</span>
hurt by any greedy person.” The words are: “<i>Beannachd
Dhia air do shuil; sop muin mu do chridhe.</i>”
(“The blessing of God on your eye; a splash of urine
about your heart.”)</p>

<p>The translation is given as received, but a “sop ”
is a “wisp,” “a loose bundle,” “a cowardly fellow.”
Attention has been called on pages 119 and 136 to
the <i>iubhar</i>, and on 171 to the <i>Fachan</i>. Compare the
darning needle’s use and its one eye to the following
found among the Wallons of Belgium. “<i>Li bwegne</i>,
le borgne. Cette singulière appellation s’explique par
la ressemblance vague que le gland et ses levres
presentent avec un œil et ses paupières. Expression
populaire: <i>sain-ni s’bwegne</i>, saigner son borgne, c’est-a-dire
[Greek: pisser].”<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p>The same significance is applied to the same thing
in the same way in Arabic, <i>El aaouar</i> (The one-eyed).<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

</div>

<p>This is “a word to the wise” which cannot here
be considered further in detail, but undoubtedly has
much to do with the preventative of the Evil Eye
mentioned, and further explanation of much before
alluded to will be evident to the one who can read
between the lines when we mention that <i>maistir</i> is
in ordinary Gaelic urine, and <i>maistrich</i> is a verb, to
churn, to shake together.</p>

<p>One other hint. A native of Garmouth on Spey
said, “I have often heard people saying that one peacock
feather given away to a person is unlucky to the
one that gets it, but that more than one is all right.
One time Sandy took one to his landlady’s little boy.
He noticed that the landlady looked displeased, and
it soon disappeared. When he was telling me about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</span>
it, I said, ‘Why did you not take two to her?’ He
replied he would have done so, but he did not
want to yield to her <i>freits</i> (superstitious fancies).”</p>

<p>Compare this with what immediately precedes it,
and notice that the offering of a single eye—a single

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
